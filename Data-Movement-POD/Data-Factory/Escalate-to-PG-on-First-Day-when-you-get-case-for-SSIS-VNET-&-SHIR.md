Subject: <Action Required> Escalate to PG on First Day when you get case for SSIS VNET/SHIR

Hi Team,

Thanks for your great effort on CY 2019, and Happy New Year to you and your family!

Recently PG did some analysis for FY19 YTD CSAT, found there are around 35% of low CSAT came from SSIS VNET/SHIR

- SSIS IR on-premise access via VNET
- SSIS IR on-premise access via “SelfHosted IR as Proxy”

PG is promising to work with/help CSS to improve this, and suggest us to escalate it to PG at the first day when you get this kind of cases from now on.

**Action: When you get SSIS VNET/SHIR case, please create one ICM to PG at the first day, PG will work with you together**

We will monitor this to see whether any improvement for a while and do some fine tune later

I copy PG Yide here, who will help to answer your questions if any, thank you!

Best Regards
Sonic
