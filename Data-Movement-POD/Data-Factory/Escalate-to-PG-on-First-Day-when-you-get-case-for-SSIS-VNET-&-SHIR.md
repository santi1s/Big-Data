Recently PG did some analysis for FY19 YTD CSAT, found there are around 35% of low CSAT came from SSIS VNET/SHIR

- SSIS IR on-premise access via VNET
- SSIS IR on-premise access via “SelfHosted IR as Proxy”

PG is promising to work with/help CSS to improve this, and suggest us to escalate it to PG at the first day when you get this kind of cases from now on.

**Action: When you get SSIS VNET/SHIR case, please create one ICM to PG at the first day, PG will work with you together**
