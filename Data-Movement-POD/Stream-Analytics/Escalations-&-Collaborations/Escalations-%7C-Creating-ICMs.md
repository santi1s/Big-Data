# What is an ICM?
An acronym for Incident Management, ICMs are internal tickets we create to involve our product groups in the troubleshooting of an issue.

# What Are ICMs for?
ICMs are not intended to be an escalation, instead the focus is on bug fixes. 

# When do we open ICMs 
In the following circumstances:
- There is evidence of a bug.
- A Subject Matter Expert (SME) or Sr. Engineer indicates an ICM is required.
- A product group members indicates an ICM is required.
- Support Request is Severity 1.

# What is not appropriate for an ICM?
- Questions that can be answered via documentation.
- Questions involving Query.
- Not sure how to troubleshoot.
- Case is beyond your technical skills

All of these questions can be answered by your colleagues or the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

# What're the step by step processes for determining when we open ICMs?
1. Engineer is assigned a case, as a team [we review the cases daily in a morning meeting](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2Fl%2Fmeetup-join%2F19%253aed61c2064c6941d2988493b7cdce55d7%2540thread.skype%2F1543822558624%3Fcontext%3D%257b%2522Tid%2522%253a%252272f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47%2522%252c%2522Oid%2522%253a%252215695086-ef6b-4241-9a66-0858a24ce131%2522%257d&data=02%7C01%7CAbiodun.Olatunji%40microsoft.com%7Cea158d123cf541185e1208d6eaaeb596%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636954433662855382&sdata=8elvPuIL5K24qgSmxcLUMA9rdePAhD6vMJStfgZ2pK4%3D&reserved=0) to determine the best course of action.
1. Based on guidance in meeting perform initial investigation: ASC, TSGs, search existing ICMs for similar issues, validate if there is an outage.
1. If after the initial investigation you are unsure of how to proceed we have a few options:
1. Reach out to colleagues via [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aed61c2064c6941d2988493b7cdce55d7%40thread.skype/z%2520-%2520Stream%2520Analytics?groupId=d6c5d9c8-f14e-4cb6-a79a-1874c3b84cb6&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47).
1. If next steps cannot be determined after collaborating with colleagues on teams...
1. Reach out to SMEs (abolatun, and camoisan). SMEs can provide guidance on next action plan and determine if ICM is needed.
1. If for some reason SMEs are not available, we have a [CSS & PG collab Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aaa42f7f4a4bd4daf88581ddc76faf624%40thread.skype/General?groupId=f4ae42e4-0a6c-44b7-8865-20266713a849&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) where engineers can share troubleshooting findings with PG and determine if it is appropriate to open ICM.

# How do I open an ICM?
From Azure Support Center:
From ICM Site:

# Can I include the PG in emails and conversations?
Product group members should not be involved in customer communications unless:

1.)The PG has requested direct involvement with the customer.
2.)CSS (support engineers and SMEs) and Customer have exhausted all their options for determining a solution or next steps. We then reach out to the PG to ask if they would be willing to get involved. Only when the PG consents are they looped into communications.
3.)Itâ€™s a Sev 1.
