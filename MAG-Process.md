1.	Go to:  https://osp.office.net/idm/identity/access/Clearances
2.	Click on the Blue Button “Request Clearances…”
3.	A new blade will open on the right.  Please select “Proof of citizenship” and in the Country Code select “US”.  Click Request.
4.	Set up a meeting with HR to bring the necessary documents shown in [US Citizenship attestation for FTEs](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/USGovCloudSupport/EanFB2HkMZpFsglChGgSDGYBy_DkKNc_kbl6dFeuSFIVuQ?e=QZ1Nmb&CID=0DBA338E-12D1-420A-8687-D070FE370725&wdLOR=c926B9D5D-D1A2-4C3E-A68B-FC697C94C5BA). They will verify the documentation in order to complete the first part of the process.
5.	Visit https://osp.office.net/idm/identity/access/Clearances and once you see "Citizenship = US" under "Granted", you are all set to proceed to the next step in the process.  If this takes longer than 5-7 business days, let me or Todd know.
6.	The next step in the process is to follow the instructions on the [Microsoft US Government Support page](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/USGovCloudSupport/SitePages/How.aspx?web=1).  Following these instructions gets you access to Azure government cases in Service Desk.
7.	The final step in this process is to request a subscription in the Azure Government (Fairfax) environment for any testing or repro work you will need to do.  That process is located [here](https://ageaccounts.azurewebsites.us/home).
