3.	A new blade will open on the right.  Please select “Proof of citizenship” and in the Country Code select “US”.  Click Request.
4.	Set up a meeting with HR to bring the necessary documents shown in US Citizenship attestation for FTEs. They will verify the documentation in order to complete the first part of the process.
5.	Visit https://osp.office.net/idm/identity/access/Clearances and once you see "Citizenship = US" under "Granted", you are all set to proceed to the next step in the process.  If this takes longer than 5-7 business days, let me or Todd know.
