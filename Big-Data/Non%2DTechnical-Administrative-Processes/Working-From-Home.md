**WFM / remote = work from home**

**Guideline / how to - Ad Hoc (not a scheduled or pre-approved arrangement)** 
1. use teams to give your LOCAL team and mgr a heads up 
2. as a back up, post your back up communication (mobile number, home number, etc)
3.  must have high speed internet (ideally mobile hotspot as a backup)
4. DO NOT need to do a WFM request/ approval. 
5.  Do NOT abuse, if so we all lose.  i.e. last minute always Monday and Fridays, team cant get a hold of you. 
6.  Be more diligent in documentation reaction to pings and cases. 
 This is very important to build a very strong case of the value and helps with leadership support. 
7. shouldn't be more then 50% of the week (ping mgr for ok in advance )

scheduled / pre-arranged  guideline / process will be captured differently.
