# **WFM / remote = work from home**

##Guideline / how to - Ad Hoc _(Not scheduled or pre-approved arrangement)_
_We are using this for simple guidelines for keeping our teams safe while supporting our customers during the COVID-19 Situation_

1. Please Use **Teams** to give your LOCAL team and mgr a heads up. 
1a.  Please use "availability status" for good. 
2. As a back up, please post your back up communication (mobile number, home number, etc) in Teams while your letting your peers know your WFH / Remote. 
3. You must have high speed internet, and ideally mobile hotspot as a backup internet connection. 
- 4. You **DO NOT** need to do a WFM request/ approval. 
5.  Please Do NOT abuse, if so we all lose.  i.e. last minute always Monday and Fridays, team cant get a hold of you. 
6.  Please be diligent in documentation reaction to pings and cases. 
 This is very important to build a very strong case of the value and helps with leadership support. 
7. Shouldn't be more then 50% of the week (ping mgr for ok in advance ) unless its directed as a safety or business continuity.
