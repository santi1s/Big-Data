#What is a Connect

Connects are regular meetings with your manager designed to facilitate conversations about the impact you have had in the last several months, how you can learn, and the impact you can have moving forward.

There is a formal structure and a guide to fill out for these meetings to help guide the conversation and recall impact and goals both for you and your manager.

There are three main sections to a connect, and you can read more about each of them here:
[Overview of Connects](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/hrw/Pages/aboutconnects.aspx?CT=1582847536330&OR=OWA-NT&CID=ffb1010c-ff49-73e4-3baa-d9041630ddfa)

1. [Core Priorities](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/hrw/Pages/UnderstandingSMSGConnectCorePriorities.aspx) - Five long-term accountabilities that are indicators of success for your role.

2. Looking Back - A section for reflection on your impact, accomplishments, how you have built off the work of others, and how you have contributed to the success of others.

3. Going Forward - A reflection on key contributions moving forward in your role, and how you would like to learn and grow.

8. Consider Growth-Mindset and Impact. These are Microsoft's core values for employees and should shape the way you think about your own work looking back and going forward.
