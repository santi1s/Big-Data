#What is a Connect

Connects are regular meetings with your manager designed to facilitate conversations about the impact you have had in the last several months, how you can learn, and the impact you can have moving forward.

There is a formal structure and a guide to fill out for these meetings to help guide the conversation and recall impact and goals both for you and your manager.

There are three main sections to a connect, and you can read more about each of them here:
[Overview of Connects](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/hrw/Pages/aboutconnects.aspx?CT=1582847536330&OR=OWA-NT&CID=ffb1010c-ff49-73e4-3baa-d9041630ddfa)

1. [Core Priorities](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/hrw/Pages/UnderstandingSMSGConnectCorePriorities.aspx) - Five long-term accountabilities that are indicators of success for your role.

2. Looking Back - A section for reflection on your impact, accomplishments, how you have built off the work of others, and how you have contributed to the success of others.

3. Going Forward - A reflection on key contributions moving forward in your role, and how you would like to learn and grow.

# Things to Consider for Your Connect

# Looking Back
1. Don't list only your cases or workload accomplishments, but also consider your overall impact on the team:
**a.** Training/Presentation Delivered
**b.** Trainings Taken/New Skills Learned
**c.** High-Impact Customer Relationship Interactions
**d.** Mentoring New Teammates
**e.** Documentation/TSG Created
**f.** Collaboration with Teammates to Resolve Issues
**g.** Interactions with product team to improve supportability.
**h.** Processes Implemented/Efficiency Increases
**i.** etc...

2. **What Could Have Been Done Differently** - This is a section for you to self-reflect on how you are learning and growning. It is not a section to make you feel badly about your performance, but is a place where you can essentially provide feedback for yourself and consider how you would like to grow.
Let it help guide your 'Moving Forward' Section.

# Going Forward

1. Key Deliverables - Consider your 'Core Priorities', your team's needs, and your own goals to fill out the key deliverables section.
Consider a few key deliverables that will be actionable in the next quarter. Things that you can implement/accomplish/focus on for the next few months.

2. Learning and Growing - This is a place to start a conversation with your manager about your goals. Both goals in your current role, and in your career. What kinds of things would you like to try? What kind of training do you want/need? How do you want to grow?

#Peer Reviews

Peer Reviews are Microsoft's feedback process between teammates that allow you to request formal feedback from your colleagues.

This feedback is not anonymous, but is guided to provide straightforward, and actionable perspectives.
##Requesting

To request feedback go to the //connect page and select 'My Feedback' and 'Request Feedback'.

Search for colleagues or select providers from the suggested list to add at least two feedback providers to your list of feedback requests.

Select 'Send' to send out feedback requests to your list of colleagues.

##Receiving Requests

When a teammate has requested feedback from you, you will receive and email notifying you of the request and can use the link in the email to fill out the Feedback Form.

You can also go to the [Perspectives Page](https://msconnect.microsoft.com/perspective/provide) to see who has requested feedback.
