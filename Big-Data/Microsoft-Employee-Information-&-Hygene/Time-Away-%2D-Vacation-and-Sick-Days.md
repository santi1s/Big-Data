# Benefits Page/Microsoft Policy
_This guide that covers best practices on the Big Data team for requesting/logging Vacation and Sick Days.
Please do refer to our benefits site (//benefits) and our Human Resources site (//hrweb) or reach out to your manager for additional questions, or conversations about specific scenarios._

##MSFT Official Holidays
You should be able to search for "holidays" in hrweb but here is the direct link
https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/hrw/Pages/globalholidays.aspx  


##MSFT Official Holidays in Big Data
Microsoft has a number of yearly holidays where you do not need to spend vacation hours.

For major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, unless you volunteer specifically to work those days, you do not need to request time off.

For more minor holidays like Presidents day, Big Data does not see a large volume drop in cases, so we treat these as a normal workday. If you want these days off, you will need to request these days through WFM like usual-- However, you do not need to spend vacation hours to take these holidays off, and if you work these days, you will be given Flex Time.

Your manager should email you about these holidays beforehand, and if you have any questions, please reach out to you manager.

You can find a list of Microsoft Holidays here on the //hrweb page: [Link](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRw/Pages/globalholidays.aspx)

### Working on a Minor Holiday
For minor holidays like President's Day (and others as reported by your managers) if you plan on working those days, there is no action you need to take. Just come in to the office as usual and you should automatically receive Flex Hours.

You can check received Flex Hours the following day in WFM. Check this guide on how to do that: [Check Flex Hours](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki?wikiVersion=GBwikiMaster&_a=edit&pagePath=%2FBig%20Data%2FMicrosoft%20Employee%20Information%20%26%20Hygene%2FTime%20Away%20%252D%20Vacation%20and%20Sick%20Days&pageId=277566&anchor=check-flex%2Flieu-days-available)

If you do not see a credit of received flex hours, please reach out to the WFM team at wfms@microsoft.com
Let them know what date you worked and that you should receive flex hours.


### Taking off a Minor Holiday
For minor holidays like President's Day (and others as reported by your managers) if you plan on NOT working that day, you will need to request it off in WFM just like any other vacation day.

In WFM, request the day as "Planned OOF" [Vacation Request Guide](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki?wikiVersion=GBwikiMaster&pagePath=%2FBig%20Data%2FMicrosoft%20Employee%20Information%20%26%20Hygene%2FTime%20Away%20%252D%20Vacation%20and%20Sick%20Days&pageId=277566&_a=edit&anchor=request-vacation)

The difference is that you DO NOT need to enter this vacation day in //tar. You do not need to take a vacation day to have this holiday off.


# Sites You Will Need
_If you do not have access to either site, please reach out to your manager or TA_

**WFM:** https://wfm2.corp.microsoft.com/WFO/WFMPRD/home/dashboard/
This site is for vacation/schedule requests as well as viewing your shift times and queue times.

**TAR:** https://tar/Common/Home.aspx (//tar)
This is the Time and Absence Microsoft site where you can see vacation and sick leave balances as well as the site where you record any vacation, sick leave, Jury Duty, or Bereavement (this guide does not cover bereavement or jury duty. Please look into benefits to reach out to your manager if you have question about bereavement or jury duty processes)
# Vacation
## Check Available Vacation Time
1. Go to //tar to check your total vacation balance as of the present date. You can see it here:
![image.png](/.attachments/image-c6a81e80-3705-4cbd-899d-13b03ae0f83a.png)

2. You can also check for any Flex/Lieu Days on WFM (see section below for Flex/Lieu Days), by going to Personal Accounts, entering the date, and checking your current balance.

## Request Vacation

_**Note that the earlier you request vacation time, the better!**_

*UPDATE*  2 ways to do this:  the Normal way and the quick way.
QUICK WAY
1. Validate the team has proper coverage for the time your taking off
     by checking the [Schedule View](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/326172/View-Schedule-Per-POD) in WFM. Follow this link to get access to that Schedule View: [Link](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/326172/View-Schedule-Per-POD)
2. Send email to WFM scheduling, CCing Manager , TA/ PTA's and SEs 
     Subject "Your alias TIME OFF START/END DATE"
     Body: suggested
      Hi WFM,  please mark me OOF for the following days
3.  if your manager doesn't approve within 2 days please ping them in chat
4. follow process below in updating Out Of Office in Outlook and tar

NORMAL WAY 
1. Go to WFM and select "Schedule Editor"
![image.png](/.attachments/image-69aea1dc-5ba4-4870-a819-717d41f47742.png)

2. Select +Segment
![image.png](/.attachments/image-ce6e7f68-914f-4494-98c4-f5f5e8db95b3.png)

3. Under 'Code', select the kind of time block you are submitting. For the purposes of vacation time, you'll either use "Planned OOF" which uses your vacation days, or Flex/Lieu Used, if you are using some earned Flex time.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-9ccb499e-b463-498b-99c6-df45ab72d0dd.png)

4. Select your date range (feel free to include weekends), and then you can use the "Days" menu to select only days you would normally have a shift. Select "All Day" if you will be out of office the full day. The Memo is optional. You do not need to report why you are taking time off.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-be46d196-0b3a-4273-8728-803886a8a9de.png)

5. Select "Add" at the bottom of the page.

```
Note that selecting "Add" does not guarantee vacation time.
This time still needs to be approved by your manager.
```

6. For a vacation that is **2 weeks or longer** , please also make a request for Pre OOF days. 
Pre OOF days are days you will be in the office but out of the queue before your vacation. You can use these days to wrap up outstanding cases and hand off any cases that will need to be tended in your absence.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-c0b528b4-338d-4107-afb2-bc48036e69ae.png)
For a vacation of two weeks, request one pre-oof day. For a longer vacation, please discuss your caseload and pre-oof plan with your manager.


7. Send an email to your manager indicating that you have submitted a request for the specified day/days, and cc the WFM scheduling team (wfms@microsoft.com).

8. if no response from Manager within 48 hours ping them in Teams chat. 

## Check if Vacation Was Approved
1. When vacation is approved and your schedule is updated, you will receive an email telling you what dates have been updated.

2. You can go to WFM, then to the schedule editor, and navigate to the requested date. If your vacation has been approved, your schedule will include a Planned OOF/ Flex Time block that will cover the whole day.

## Add Vacation to Outlook Calendar

After your vacation is approved, you should add an Out of Office appointment to your outlook, so you appear out of office when coworkers try to ping you or try to request a meeting time.

1. In Outlook, go to New Items, then 'Appointment'
![image.png](/.attachments/image-aaab7bd6-fa28-4c9c-9dab-b5f0cfed0b6f.png)

2. Set 'Show As' to Out of Office and 'Reminder' to None. Title it with <your alias> OOF, and select the appropriate time range. Then save the appointment.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-b6a0a8d7-8903-47a6-adf2-66b59b652ac9.png)

You can also add your vacation to a teammates calendar! Do this if you have teammates you work closely with, like members of your POD. **But do not send your teammates an appointment that is set to 'Show As' Out of Office.**
To add your vacation to a teammate's calendar (so they know when you are out, and when you will be back) do the following:
1. In Outlook, select 'New Item' and then 'Appointment'. Then, to invite others, click 'Invite Attendees' 
![image.png](/.attachments/image-aaab7bd6-fa28-4c9c-9dab-b5f0cfed0b6f.png)
![image.png](/.attachments/image-1ebb5bfe-2247-42f1-83b3-3a9b556ececf.png)

2. Be sure to Set 'Show As' to Free and 'Reminder' to None. 
Add all relevant team members under "Required", mark the appropriate days, and add a note about your vacation days and when you'll be back for quick reference.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-7620f7f3-a2dd-4a02-b058-916ae9cf67c7.png)

## Automatic Replies
For long vacation or sick days, it is good to set automatic replies that contain your expected return date, so teammates and customers know when you are expected to be back, and if there are any other avenues of communication open to them in your absence. Below are example automatic replies for both Internal, and External communications, as well as steps to set them.

1. In Outlook, go to 'File', then to 'Automatic Replies'
![image.png](/.attachments/image-d62146c0-06d8-4b19-9cb4-c05ae28bf6d9.png)
![image.png](/.attachments/image-244dddfa-1461-40fc-b7ff-1ee57ad00490.png)

2. Set the option to 'Send Automatic Replies', and then 'Only send during this time range'
Set the time range for the dates of your vacation. 
![image.png](/.attachments/image-9c7dc90c-37da-41a6-a33f-57dc02e435da.png)

3. You'll note there are two reply options, one for Inside your Organization (the message people within Microsoft will receive) and Outside your Organization (the message outside customers will receive).
Please set both, though do use different messages. Here are some examples.

## Case Handoff for Vacation

For short vacations, handoff is only necessary for critical or active cases, or cases where customers would like to meet during your time away.

For longer vacations, please close what cases you can. For critical or very active cases, let your customers know you will be away and that you will be handing their case to a teammate. If at all possible, find a teammate in your POD who will be able to take the case, and provide a warm handoff.

For slower cases where you are waiting on the customer or product team, and don't expect any update will be needed until after your return, please let the customer know of your absence and confirm if they are alright to have an update on your return, or if they would prefer to be handed off to another engineer in the meantime. 

If you are not able to find a case owner for cases that need handoff during your time away, please reach out to your TA with a list of cases, for each case including number, product, brief description, brief status.

## Record Vacation Hours

After your vacation has been approved, or on the first day back from your vacation, you'll need to log your vacation hours in Time and Absence Reporting (TAR). This is how all your vacation and sick hours are tracked and logged.

1. Go to //tar, and navigate to the dates of your vacation:
![image.png](/.attachments/image-7e4c4d49-4711-4a18-aebc-94c1f5edd082.png)

2. Enter your usual number of work hours under the "Vacation" column for all your vacation days. If you are not ready to submit the hours or need more time to edit, select 'Save'. If the hours are finalized, please select 'Submit'. **Please note that to log your hours they must be 'Submitted', and not only saved.**
