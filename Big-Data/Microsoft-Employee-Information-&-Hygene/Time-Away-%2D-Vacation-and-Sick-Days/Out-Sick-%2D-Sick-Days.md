If you need more time than your current sick leave balance allows, please reach out to your manager. Microsoft has a lot of options to work with you through medical absences. 

## Who to Reach Out to When You Are Sick

If you are ill and need to take a sick day, please send an email to wfms@microsoft.com and your manager, requesting that you be marked as unexpected oof/sick.


## Automatic Replies

For long vacation or sick days, it is good to set automatic replies that contain your expected return date, so teammates and customers know when you are expected to be back, and if there are any other avenues of communication open to them in your absence. Below are example automatic replies for both Internal, and External communications, as well as steps to set them.

1. In Outlook, go to 'File', then to 'Automatic Replies'

2. Set the option to 'Send Automatic Replies', and then 'Only send during this time range'
Set the time range for the dates of your vacation.

3. You'll note there are two reply options, one for Inside your Organization (the message people within Microsoft will receive) and Outside your Organization (the message outside customers will receive).
Please set both, though do use different messages. Here are some examples.

## Case Handling for Sick Days

Please follow the Unexpected OOF guidelines for handing off cases on sick days: [Unexpected OOF Case Handoff](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/306262/Case-Hand-Off-Process?anchor=hand-off-for-unexpected-oof)

For any **scheduled meetings** with customers, please reschedule, or arrange for a teammate to join the meeting instead.

## Record Sick Days

On the first day back from your sick day/days, you'll need to log your hours in Time and Absence Reporting (TAR). This is how all your vacation and sick hours are tracked and logged.

1. Go to //tar, and navigate to your sick days:

2. Enter your usual number of work hours under the "Vacation" column for all your vacation days. If you are not ready to submit the hours or need more time to edit, select 'Save'. If the hours are finalized, please select 'Submit'. **Please note that to log your hours they must be 'Submitted', and not only saved.**
