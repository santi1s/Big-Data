# Guidelines 
## Use WFH or Site Request or Tech Link?

This is situational - high level:
- if the local site has the inventory - will be for headset replacements, additional wireless headset, monitors, etc.     reviewing the WFH buying program will best guide for you, for that time, and situation
- if you have a broken / failing piece of hardware - [aka.ms/itweb](aka.ms/itweb) for Tech Link
- new employees the manager will use the Site Request.

## Process 
Regardless of which guide you follow, please give you're manager a heads up, each guide / tool has different approval engines, for example the site request you're required to get you're managers approval prior to submitting the request.

Review the links of each and ping leads and manager for suggestions after you've reviewed these options.  

## Hardware Refresh Guideline
Typical hardware refresh is the latest capitalization date +36 months but may vary per org.
Reach out to your manager with questions!  

## Asset tracking
For information about your machine or any other Microsoft-issued assets, you can use the Asset Link tool!
Go to //AssetLink and it will trigger the install of the AssetLink app.

Once that app loads you search for your alias as the "Custodian"
