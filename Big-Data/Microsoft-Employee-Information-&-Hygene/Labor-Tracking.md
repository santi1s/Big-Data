Any time you will perform any type of work on a case, you will need to track the time spent. This is **mandatory** and extremely important, so please try to be as accurate as possible in tracking and describing the performed work.

The labor is classified in following categories, which are self explanatory: Communications, Recovery & Billing, Research, Admin Review, Tech Review, Troubleshooting. If you are not sure which category to choose, please reach your mentor/TA/SME.
