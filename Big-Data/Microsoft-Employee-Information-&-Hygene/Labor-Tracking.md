# Mandatory Tasks

1. Record any labor worked on your cases the same day it is worked. 
By 11:59 pm local time.

2. Record accurate labor daily for your cases, only submitting the actual labor, and submitting all of the actual labor for each case.

3. Labor cannot be projected to a future date-- only enter labor the day it is worked.

4. If you worked a case, but missed entering labor before 11:59pm local time, [you may enter late labor](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/295071/Labor-Tracking?anchor=how-to-enter-labor-late), but be certain to accurately record the date it was worked, and enter a reason the labor was entered late.
5. If you entered labor on the incorrect case, or entered the labor incorrectly, you should [adjust the labor entry](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/295071/Labor-Tracking?anchor=adjust-labor) in a timely manner.

# How to Enter Labor Late
If you missed the daily time entry for labor, you can enter the labor late, just be certain to correctly mark the day it was worked.

Enter labor just like normal, but for the date choose the correct date worked and add a brief description and select a late labor reason as accurately as possible.

##Scorecard (Customer) Labor

Most labor tracking will occur when working with customers and researching issues. The labor will be captured in your case tool.
Any time you will perform any type of work on a case, you will need to track the time spent. This is **mandatory** and extremely important, so please try to be as accurate as possible in tracking and describing the performed work.

The labor is classified in following categories, which are self explanatory: Communications, Recovery & Billing, Research, Admin Review, Tech Review, Troubleshooting. If you are not sure which category to choose, please reach your mentor/TA/SME.
