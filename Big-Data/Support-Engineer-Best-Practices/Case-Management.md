The following the best practices listed below and implemented rigorously, would help you grow in your technical journey and also make you feel satisfied when you resolve the customer issue.

# Case Documentation (CXD Capability)

_(updated 9/30/2020)_

# Review Factors
| ****Case Review factors** | **Description**** |
|--|--|
| **SLA met** | Was SLA met? If missed, update notes to say why |
| **ASC viewed** | Was ASC viewed? Did you click on each insight and provide feedback? |
|**FQR**  | Was there a good First Quality Response? |
| **Check/Update Support Area Path** | Does the support area path match what the case was opened for? |
| **LQR** | Did you send a Last Quality Response which included a good summary of the issue, the cause, and the steps you took to resolve the issue? |
| **Idle time**  | Were there gaps 3 days or more with no communication to the customer and no updates to the case notes? |
| **ICM** | Was an ICM filed? If so, was the ICM field updated? Was the ICM filed in a timely manner? Did you include all of the required information in the ICM? Was the ICM handled in a timely fashion by Product Group? |
| **Case Notes** | Are case notes added after each interaction with the case? Were the notes easy to understand if the case is handed over or reviewed? |
| **Agent Identified Root Cause** | Did you select the most accurate root cause available in the root cause tree? |
| **Cause** | Upon case closure, is the Cause field clear and detailed enough? |
| **Resolution** | Upon case closure, could another Support Engineer understand the steps you took to resolve the issue? |
| **Symptom** | Upon case closure, did you write a clear symptom? (Don't just copy the case Title) |

# Understanding customer problem
It is critical to ensure the problem description is fully understood and can be restated in the ICM.  This can be achieved only when you understand the customer problem well through prompting question to customer and clarifying the question with customer.  I would strongly urge you all to have  phone calls as much as possible to ensure you understand the customer issue, and collecting the required data in the initial engagement with the customer.  This would help to avoid multiple round trips and raise the CRI with clear ask to the engineering team.

# Scoping
Scoping the problem is very important before we even start investigating the issue.  Scoping helps us to set a clear target and expectation with customer from a Support Ticket perspective.    Please do remember scoping would not make sense without the clear understanding the problem as stated above.
Also, avoid just copying the customer initial problem description as scoping email.  This is not meant to just complete a process, rather it would help you understand the customer issue and setup the correct expectation to customer.

Scope creep triggers 
1.	long running Support case and ICM .   
2.	Less than top CSAT number even after putting lot of effort in solving the customer issue.  Since customer remembers that it took long time to resolve the issue
3.	High Labor case.

## How to handle Scope creep
Requesting customer to open a new ticket  and continue working with the customer in addressing  the bigger issue.  I am pretty sure customer would understand if you offer them to continue on the new ticket.


## Advantage of new support ticket when scope creep occurs.

1.	It show the progress made in their journey in solving their bigger issue.
2.	It helps you get faster response from engineering since there is no confusion in the customer issue.

# Documenting Your Analysis /Collecting Relevant data/Enclosing

The scoping / understanding the customer problem helps to identify the data required to solve the issue in the initial engagement.   

Adding your analysis as an additional section in the CRI would help you get the following
1.	More attention from the engineering since they see efforts made to solve before engaging them.  
2.	Engineering would share more details based on your analysis triggering your growth in your technical journey.
3.	Earn respect from engineering which would help you get relationship and faster response for any queries.

Collecting and Attaching the logs, helps you avoid engineering team requesting additional data  triggering round trip delay in resolving  the customer issue.   Please feel free to sent note to Jim/Bala/Rajesh for any initial data which you feel needs to be collected as part of Support Case creation.

Additionally its very important that you review the logs collected and ensure the logs is reflecting the data fact reported by the customer.   Reviewing/Analyzing the logs would help you to learn new things and ask more question to me or engineering through ICM. This would make you confident and ready to answer any further question from customers.

# ICM Severity
Finally, creating the ICM with correct Severity is very critical to have  great engineering engagement.  I would urge you to follow the CRI  Severity flow  to identify the correct severity.  The important point is that understanding the customer issue and how its impacting their business would help you decide the correct severity and would help you justify the same to the engineering team.   “Please ensure you document the business impact in CRI by filling up the “Business Justification” field.

##What you SHOULD NOT Tell Your Customer
##What you CAN Tell Your Customer

# Take aways
1.	Ensure the customer problem is understood clearly
2.	Scope the issue and also ensure multiple issues are not handled in single ICM or Support Tickets.
3.	Document your Analysis/logs collected to the ICM.
4.	Configure the ICM Severity based on the customer’s business impact (loss of revenue, loss of sites or business down).
