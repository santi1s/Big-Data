Last Quality Response (LQR) gives you an opportunity to leave the customer with a good last impression. Set the expectation that a closing email will be sent that captures the issue and resolution. This is something customer can always use if the issue happens again.

# Best practices

The following outline comprises the major components of a standard LQR email. You should strive to apply it _in full_ with every LQR email you write. However, you should also use your best judgement and adapt this outline on a case-by-case basis. Don't blindly follow templates--_personalize your emails!_

1. Address the customer by their personal name.
1. Greet the customer cordially.
1. State the purpose of the email.
1. Paraphrase what the customer requested of us (Microsoft).
   * Note salient symptoms of the problem, if applicable.
   * Note extraordinary business need, if applicable.
1. Describe what we did to fulfill the customer's request(s).
   * Show the business value that we (Microsoft Support) provided.
   * Describe our solution/answer in "just enough" detail as to be useful for posterity.
   * Recap our root cause analysis (RCA) _only if requested_.
1. Welcome the customer to reopen the cause through the Azure Portal if the issue returns, _only if necessary to assuage the customer's hesitancy to close the case._
1. Advise the customer for the future.
   * Share salient best practices / "expert" tips.
   * Refer the customer to relevant resources they may not know about: specific [architecture guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/), useful [quickstart templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/), new [feature releases](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/), etc.
1. Inform the customer of the post-case survey.
   * (It is a brief survey about the quality of support we provided on the case.)
   * Graciously ask the customer to complete the survey and/or express your sincere interest in their feedback.
1. Thank the customer for using Microsoft products.
1. Insert your full Microsoft email signature.
   * Include contact information for you and your manager.

# Worst practices

Do **not** do any of the following:

* Contact the customer and/or close their case on holidays, weekends, after working hours, etc.
* Close a case without receiving explicit customer approval to do so. _(except in the case of chronically unresponsive customers; see below)_
* Close a case on an unresponsive customer without waiting at least two (2) weeks since the successful contact with the customer.

# Dissatisfied customers

If you think that customer can be dissatisfied for any reason, then:

1. Discuss as soon as possible this case with a Senior Engineer or Technical Advisor, they may suggest looping in the PG as well. **_Do not delay asking for help if the customer is dissatisfied_**
2. Contact the TAM (_**for Premier cases**_)
3. Follow the process for CSAT Impacting IcMs (for participating product groups) and consider making a recovery call.

# Unresponsive customers

The below workflow gives a general idea about the process for CSS to follow when working with an un-responsive customer. **_CSS should always consider the case context and customer sentiment_**.

# Examples

You may emulate the following examples of LQR emails, but you should not copy them directly. **Always personalize every email to any customer**. Customer communication should not only be unmistakably cordial, but also impart a sense of individualized consideration. Be personable!
