Your notes should give the next engineer a full picture of the case even if a warm handoff cannot occur.

If any of these cases need handoff, find a teammate who will be able to take the case and provide a warm handoff.

3. Please **do not** just push batches of your case back to queue even if you are unable to find teammates to assist you. In this case, please reach out to your TA with a list of cases, and for each case including number, product, brief description, and brief status.
