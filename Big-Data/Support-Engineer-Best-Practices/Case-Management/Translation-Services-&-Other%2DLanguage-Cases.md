## How to Handle Other-Language Cases
We do not currently have full language coverage in AMER, so if you receive a case in your region for a language you do not speak, the case is still your responsibility.

Below are the options available for written and spoken communications.

Some of our AMER teammates do handle Spanish-Speaking cases and may be able to collaborate to assist.
And some of our EMEA and APAC teammates may be able to help with other languages. 
Feel free to reach out to them directly, but follow the steps below.

## Email Translation

For other-language cases, use internet translation services to write your communications, and include both your original communication and the translation in any communication.

Also **always let your customer know you are doing this in the first line of any translated, written communication.**

### Quick Steps
1. Write the email out in English as normal.
2. Add something like this as the first line of the email:
	"I do not speak <LANGUAGE>, and so am using a translation service for written communication. I have included the original English email below for convenience, but if you have any questions or if anything is unclear, please let me know. I will be happy to clarify."
3. Use an internet translation service (like [Bing Translate](https://www.bing.com/translator/) or [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)) to translate your email into the needed language. (Note that Google translate often does a better job and might be the better translation choice, especially for Portuguese cases)
4. Add translation to the top part of the email, then add a break, and the original english email to the bottom. Feel free to follow the example below.

### Example - Portuguese Translation
