# Best Practices

## Dos

1. If you are working with the product team, and they have provided some technical information that you don't understand/aren't sure you can communicate to the customer, ask questions until you understand what they're asking!
2. Rephrase product group communications to be customer facing. Provide steps where possible.
3. Confirm with the product team if specific technical information/product limitations can be communicated with the customer. Especially for bigger customers, sometimes a project manager should be involved to make sure we're communicating limitations correctly.
4. If you're going to have a phone call or a screen sharing session, write down the points you intend to cover during the call.

## Don'ts

1. Don't just copy and paste what the product team tells you for a customer. Rephrase it to make it more personal/useful to the customer.
2. Don't ask the product team to give you a verbatim for your customer. The product team can provide technical information, but it is up to CSS to make that technical information relevant to the customer.
# Templates
**NOTE**
**These Templates are intended to be starting places. Please do personalize/update them to suit your customers and your cases.**
