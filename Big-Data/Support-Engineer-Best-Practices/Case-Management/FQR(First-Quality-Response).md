**First Quality Response (FQR) is a new behavior for delivering initial response to the customer for CSS.** The focus is to ensure the first engagement with the customer is done by an Engineer that is prepared, personalizes a response, and intends to make progress towards resolving the customer’s issue. (We call this the **3 P's: Prepared, Personalized, Progress**).

Time to initial contact may be slightly longer, but customer satisfaction is higher because the issue gets resolved or progress toward resolution is made in the first contact. 

We want the customer to come away from their initial interaction feeling they are working with someone who is going to quickly resolve their situation. First impressions count. We want to eliminate non-value-added activities. 

A First Quality Response is more than a “handshake”, a repetition of the customer’s problem description, or a list of things we won’t do. The more progress that is made towards resolution, the higher the ‘Quality’ of the customer interaction.
