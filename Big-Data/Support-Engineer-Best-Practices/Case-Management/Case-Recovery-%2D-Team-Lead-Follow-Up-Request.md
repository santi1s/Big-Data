# What's a Recovery Request?

If you have a case where your customer is dissatisfied for any reason or you think the case may receive a low survey score, you should reach out to your manager or TA for a 'Recovery Request'. This is a request that your manager or TA reach out personally to the customer to speak with them about any feedback.

This helps make sure our customers feel heard, but it also helps our team leads get feedback on how our team can improve.

# What's a Positive Follow Up Request?

If you have a case where your customer was super thrilled/satisfied with case resolution, reach out to your manager or TA with a 'Positive Follow Up Request'

This is a request that your manager or TA follow up directly with your customer to gather any feedback and to encourage your customer to fill out a survey.

This helps our customers feel cared for and again, lets our team leads gather feedback on what we're doing right.
