#Why Write Case Notes?
The goal of your notes should be that anyone that  looks at your latest case notes should be able to quickly identify the issue your are addressing, the current status, and what the planned next steps are.

Write the notes you would want to see if you were coming to the case totally new and need to pick up where the last engineer left off.

This will make it easy for you to trace your steps later, and for your fellow engineers to be able to help if you open a collaboration, need to hand off, take a sick day, or just need a second opinion!

And most importantly, **great case notes will save you time**.

# How to Take Great Notes

## Goal of Great Notes

Great case notes allow **anyone** to look at your **latest notes** and fully understand your case in **15 minutes** or fewer.

This will save you, your customers, and your fellow engineers lots of time.

## Steps to Reach the Goal
There are only 3 steps you need to take to have great case notes, and they are listed below in order of importance.

### Thorough Information
**If someone else reviews your case, they should only need to look at your latest notes to get started.**

Your latest notes need to contain the below thorough, but summarized information:

1. **Issue Summary** - Summary of the issue you are trying to solve including the most relevant error code, the behavior the customer expects to see, the end goal and/or the behavior the customer is seeing instead.

2. **Current Status** - Most recent troubleshooting steps, their results, as well as any current thinking. The 'Issue Summary' focuses on the problem to be solved, 'Current Status' gives a summary of the last steps that were taken on the case.

3. **Next Steps** - Short, clear, enumerated next steps ordered by all parties involved including: Microsoft Case Owner, Collaboration Engineer, Product Team, Third Party Partner, and Your Customer.

4. **Severity Explanation/Business Impact** - Explanation of current severity, why it should stay that way, customer temperature, and the impact the issue is having on the customer.

5. **ICM Information** - Provide the link for any ICMs associated with the case. If there are multiple, provide information on which ICMs are associated with which teams and their status.

6. **All Collected Research** - Logs, queries, internet links, provide the means to find your research again as well as a summary of what you learned from those logs and links.

7. **Current Analysis of Information** - Include your current ideas about what's going on or what data needs to be gathered next. What is your current analysis?

8. **TSGs/ASC Used** - If you found any information on a TSG or in ASC, include that information and where you found it.

9. **Conversation Summaries** - For any internal conversations on Teams on in email that provided helpful information include who your talked to and a summary of what you learned from the conversation.
**Don't just copy and paste the full conversation.** Summarize your learning.

### Clear Formatting
Clear formatting will make it quick and easy to reference your notes without having to read the full update. 

1. **Add sections in your notes for quick reference.**
The above information guides make great sections, but we also have some templates to use below.

2. **Use text formatting to highlight important information.**
This way the next engineer will always see it.

3. **Use a Notes Template for quick standardization.**
