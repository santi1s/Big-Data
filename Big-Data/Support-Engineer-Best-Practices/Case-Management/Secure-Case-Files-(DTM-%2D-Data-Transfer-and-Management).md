Does your customer need to send you files securely?
Do they need to send you example files/screenshots?

The tool we use to do this securely is called DTM (Data Transfer and Management) DTM is the site you use when a customer has already attached files to a case.

But if they didn't attach a file when they opened the case, here's what you can do:

# Create a File Store for a Case
Go to: http://aka.ms/DTMServiceDesk.  
You'll need to enter the case number and select the Go button.

# Provide Customer Access
To give your customer access to DTM and provide a link you can email, go to DTM and select 'Customer Access'
