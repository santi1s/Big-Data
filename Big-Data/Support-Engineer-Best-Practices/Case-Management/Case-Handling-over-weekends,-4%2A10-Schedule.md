## **Guidelines on Case Handling (weekends):** 

**Primary Technologies of Support Engineer (SE):**
- The cases related to the Support Engineer (SE) primary technologies will be handled similar way as he/she does on any other day. 
- If it is critsits, try to resolve the issue or at least provide the workaround for time being to reduce the Severity. 
- If you need to contact the Product Team to further investigate on the issue, try to understand the impact of the issue unless it is heavy production break for customer do not escalate ICM to Sev2. Also, try to set the expectations to the customer regarding the availability of product team (depending on region where PG team is from). Update the case dates and try to do warm handoff by joining the APAC case handover meeting. 
**_Note**: Please try to get the approval from the EEE/SME/ONCALLMANAGER to raise the Severity 2 ICM to the ADF Product team as per latest guidelines._

**Other Technologies under POD:** 
- When you get pinged for help on cases related to technologies that you’re not familiar with under your pod. 
- Try to go through the case details, see if they are any related TSG’s under that technology wiki page, if there is no relevant TSG try to check related documents and see if you could resolve it. 
- Still you couldn’t address the issue check if the person on the call is from same technology as the case you received, if so engage the on call engineer. If not, try to raise an ICM to the corresponding PG team to help you assist on the case further. 

**Other Case handling situations on Weekend:** 
If you had to open a collaboration task to any partnering team for the case you have, try to reach out to Duty Manager on shift to assign it accordingly. It will be great if we have at least couple of engineers from each PODs on weekends to assist with the cases and collaboration tasks. It also important to maintain good relationships with Duty Manager because they can really help in getting assigned the collaboration tasks or help from other teams (both Outside and Inside the Big Data POD). 
 

## **Guidelines for Holiday Handling:** 

**For Personal Holidays:** 
Should be the regular process that you follow for the holidays. Check with your manager prior to two weeks if it is planned OOF. For sick leaves it is regular process as well. 
_**Note:** If you are working on 4*10 shifts and take a leave or holiday on weekend they will be treated as 10 hours off unlike 8 hours off for holidays of whole day._ 

**For US Holidays or observances:** 
•	If the Holiday falls on your working day, you can either volunteer to work on the Holiday or take off by asking the WFM to update your schedule. If you’re working you can request for the Flex Holiday. 
_**Note:** If you would like to take off on the Holiday you have to drop an email to WFM that you're taking the Holiday. If not, they you will be still shown as working and you get assigned the Flex Holiday automatically._ 
•	If the Holiday falls on non-working hours as per your schedule, you can request for a flex holiday to your manager. Since you are not able to take advantage of the holiday.
