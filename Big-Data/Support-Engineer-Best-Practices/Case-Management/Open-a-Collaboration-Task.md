# What is a Collaboration Task
A Collaboration Task is a task within a Service Desk case that can be assigned to another engineer for their assistance/collaboration on your case.

Generally, these tasks are assigned to engineers from another team when you need expertise from another product to resolve your issue.

# How to Open a Collaboration Task
1. Open your case in Service Desk and select 'Edit' in the upper right-hand corner.

**-OR-**
Use 'Assign to Agent' and fill out a specific Engineer's alias/name to assign directly to a specific engineer. (_Do not do this unless you have **already** spoken with that engineer and they have agreed to take the case._ **Under most circumstances, use Route By Area Path to ensure good distribution of cases on a team.**)
