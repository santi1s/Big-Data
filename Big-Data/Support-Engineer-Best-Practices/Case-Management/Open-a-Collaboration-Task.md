# What is a Collaboration Task
A Collaboration Task is a task within a Service Desk case that can be assigned to another engineer for their assistance/collaboration on your case.

Generally, these tasks are assigned to engineers from another team when you need expertise from another product to resolve your issue.

# How to Open a Collaboration Task
1. Open your case in Service Desk and select 'Edit' in the upper right-hand corner.

Choose the Product, Support Topic, and Support Subtopic based on the issue you need the collaboration engineer to address.

**-OR-**
Use 'Assign to Agent' and fill out a specific Engineer's alias/name to assign directly to a specific engineer. (_Do not do this unless you have **already** spoken with that engineer and they have agreed to take the case._ **Under most circumstances, use Route By Area Path to ensure good distribution of cases on a team.**)

9. Copy and paste the notes from your collaboration task into your Service Desk Case's regular notes under the title "Collaboration Task for <Team/Product>"

# When to Open a Collaboration Task
1. If you need expertise from another team and it is more than a quick question.
2. If you need a quick question answered by another team and you are not certain who to contact.
3. If you are working closely with an engineer on your own team who is providing collaboration/labor and is completing tasks separate from yours.
4. If you are transferring a case to another team to drive the case, but your team still needs to be involved, create a collaboration task for yourself, assign it to yourself, then transfer the case to the other team.

# How to Write a Successful Collaboration Task

1. State what Team/What Expert you are looking for.
2. State a description of the issue you need this collaboration to address.
3. State the specific questions/information you need provided or answered from the collaboration.
4. Provide any relevant Notes/Logs/Research information that will help the collaboration Engineer Complete their task.

5. After submitting the collaboration task, copy and paste all this collaboration information into case notes titled "Collaboration Task for <Team/Product>"
