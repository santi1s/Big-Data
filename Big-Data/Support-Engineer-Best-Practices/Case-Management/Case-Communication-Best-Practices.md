## First Quality Response (FQR)

**First Quality Response (FQR) is a new behavior for delivering initial response to the customer for CSS.** The focus is to ensure the first engagement with the customer is done by an Engineer that is prepared, personalizes a response, and intends to make progress towards resolving the customer’s issue. (We call this the **3 P's: Prepared, Personalized, Progress**).

Time to initial contact may be slightly longer, but customer satisfaction is higher because the issue gets resolved or progress toward resolution is made in the first contact. 

We want the customer to come away from their initial interaction feeling they are working with someone who is going to quickly resolve their situation. First impressions count. We want to eliminate non-value-added activities. 

A First Quality Response is more than a “handshake”, a repetition of the customer’s problem description, or a list of things we won’t do. The more progress that is made towards resolution, the higher the ‘Quality’ of the customer interaction. 

Find the [FQR Template](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464166#Templates).

## Last Quality Response

Last Quality Response (LQR) gives you an opportunity to leave the customer with a good last impression. Set the expectation that a closing email will be sent that captures the issue and resolution. This is something customer can always use if the issue happens again.

### Outline for email

The following outline comprises the major components of a standard LQR email. You should strive to apply it _in full_ with every LQR email you write. However, you should also use your best judgement and adapt this outline on a case-by-case basis. Don't blindly follow templates--_personalize your emails!_

1. Address the customer by their personal name.
1. Greet the customer cordially.
1. State the purpose of the email.
1. Paraphrase what the customer requested of us (Microsoft).
   * Note salient symptoms of the problem, if applicable.
   * Note extraordinary business need, if applicable.
1. Describe what we did to fulfill the customer's request(s).
   * Show the business value that we (Microsoft Support) provided.
   * Describe our solution/answer in "just enough" detail as to be useful for posterity.
   * Recap our root cause analysis (RCA) _only if requested_.
1. Welcome the customer to reopen the cause through the Azure Portal if the issue returns, _only if necessary to assuage the customer's hesitancy to close the case._
1. Advise the customer for the future.
   * Share salient best practices / "expert" tips.
   * Refer the customer to relevant resources they may not know about: specific [architecture guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/), useful [quickstart templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/), new [feature releases](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/), etc.
1. Inform the customer of the post-case survey.
   * (It is a brief survey about the quality of support we provided on the case.)
   * Graciously ask the customer to complete the survey and/or express your sincere interest in their feedback.
1. Thank the customer for using Microsoft products.
1. Insert your full Microsoft email signature.
   * Include contact information for you and your manager.

### Good practices

You SHOULD do all of the following:

* Always personalize emails.
* Adapt messaging templates to the specific context.
* Include your manager's contact information in your email signature.

### Bad practices

You SHOULD NOT do any of the following:

* Contact the customer and/or close their case on holidays, weekends, after working hours, etc.
* Close a case without receiving explicit customer approval to do so. _(except in the case of chronically unresponsive customers; see below)_
* Close a case on an unresponsive customer without waiting at least two (2) weeks since the successful contact with the customer.


# Unresponsive customers

The below workflow gives a general idea about the process for CSS to follow when working with an un-responsive customer. **_CSS should always consider the case context and customer sentiment_**.

![LQR Flow_Un-Responsive Customers.jpg](/.attachments/LQR%20Flow_Un-Responsive%20Customers-9387c391-dfdb-425a-b191-bb60dc17e83d.jpg)


# Dissatisfied customers

If you think that customer can be dissatisfied for any reason, then:

1. Discuss as soon as possible this case with a Senior Engineer or Technical Advisor, they may suggest looping in the PG as well. **_Do not delay asking for help if the customer is dissatisfied_**
2. Contact the TAM (_**for Premier cases**_)
3. Follow the process for CSAT Impacting IcMs (for participating product groups) and consider making a recovery call.


## Attach Outlook Email to Service Desk Case
1. Add the case number to the email subject.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-59e856f4-6b21-43e3-b8e3-c1a870375860.png)

2. Add support@mail.support.microsoft.com in the CC line
![image.png](/.attachments/image-f6584e02-6466-4281-8f07-a0402cb06abf.png)

Now when you send your email it will get attached to your service desk case.

Template:

# Best Practices

## Dos

1. If you are working with the product team, and they have provided some technical information that you don't understand/aren't sure you can communicate to the customer, ask questions until you understand what they're asking!
2. Rephrase product group communications to be customer facing. Provide steps where possible.
3. Confirm with the product team if specific technical information/product limitations can be communicated with the customer. Especially for bigger customers, sometimes a project manager should be involved to make sure we're communicating limitations correctly.
4. If you're going to have a phone call or a screen sharing session, write down the points you intend to cover during the call.

## Don'ts

1. Don't just copy and paste what the product team tells you for a customer. Rephrase it to make it more personal/useful to the customer.
2. Don't ask the product team to give you a verbatim for your customer. The product team can provide technical information, but it is up to CSS to make that technical information relevant to the customer.
# Templates
**NOTE**
**These Templates are intended to be starting places. Please do personalize/update them to suit your customers and your cases.**
**You may emulate the following examples of emails, but you should not copy them directly. _Always personalize every email to any customer._ Customer communication should not only be unmistakably cordial, but also impart a sense of individualized consideration. Be personable!**
