# Internal Subscription Best Practices

Don't leave Cx reproductions running.
Don't leave VMs running over the weekened.
Don't leave HDI clusters running over the weekend.
Basically, don't leave anything running over the weekend unless strictly necessary.

Pick a naming convention to use for all your resources for easy management.

Using different resource groups for different customer repros also makes for easy management.
