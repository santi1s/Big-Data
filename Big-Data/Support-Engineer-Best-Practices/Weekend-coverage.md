**EMEA time zone**


- Working hours
 ON DUTY + ON CALL The EMEA working hours are 7 AM â€“ 4 PM Portugal time (regardless of daylight savings).
	
- Saturday/Sunday on duty chat
A very good practice that we have during weekends is to create a chat with the engineers that are on duty from EMEA + IST, including Mindtree, and we ask the DM to update on the chat any incoming case. This ensures an even distribution and helps us to cooperate easier in case of high volume on a single technology.

- On call
The engineers that are On Duty can ask the DM to engage the on call engineer, or they can directly engage the On Call engineers who are listed in the TeamCapacityCalculator 

- Research hours  
There are no research hours during the weekend.

- Lunch time 
Please do not mark any lunch hours in WFM. When you will go to take lunch, please notify directly the DM and the rest of the team in the group chat, so that the rest of the engineers can back you up during that time frame.
