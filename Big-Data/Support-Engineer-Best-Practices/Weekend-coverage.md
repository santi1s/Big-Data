|Working hours (on call + on duty)| **7 AM â€“ 4 PM Portugal time** (regardless of daylight savings) |  |  |  |
| How to engage on call engineers | The engineers that are On Duty can ask the DM to engage the on call engineer, or they can directly engage the On Call engineers who are listed in the TeamCapacityCalculator.  |  |  |  |
| Research hours |There are no research hours during the weekend.  |  |  |  |
| Lunch break | Please do not mark any lunch hours in WFM. When you will go to take lunch, please notify directly the DM and the rest of the team in the group chat, so that the rest of the engineers can back you up during that time frame. |  |  |  |
| Good practices | At the start of the shift, one of the engineers that is working will create a chat with: the DM of the day, all the on duty engineers from EMEA + IST, including Mindtree, and will ask the DM to update on the chat if there is any incoming case. This ensures an even distribution of cases and helps us to cooperate easier in case of high volume on a single technology. |  |  |  |
