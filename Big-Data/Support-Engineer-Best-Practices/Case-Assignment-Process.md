#What is a Duty Manager
Duty Managers are a team of people who manage cases that come into the queue and triage them based on severity, product and available engineers.

They will then assign cases to available engineers, or reach out to engineers based on the process below.

#How Cases Are Assigned By Duty Managers

Please find below the front end case assignment process for Big Data Queue followed by DMâ€™s Globally(APAC/EMEA/AMER).

1. Check SE's availability on WFM and assign the ticket via RAT/Case Buddy with respect to Skillset
2. Assignment is done based on Round Robin Fashion
3. 1 hour is the break between assignment of ticket with Sev (Prem B/C, Pro A/B/C)
4. 4 hour is the break between assignment for Prem A
5. If in case the available SE's bandwidth is exhausted due to Case Cap Limit Reached or Engaged on Critsit. We check the next available SE using WFM, if in case the SE's is available well within SLA of ticket will wait for his assignment slot and  assign via RAT/Case Buddy.
6. If in case there is threat to SLA before the next SE's availability we will inform to Pod Lead in prior and also relay the same to team over MS Teams channel. Most of the time it will be picked up by available SE voluntarily once posted in group chat and also Pod Lead will help on finding a resource. But, unfortunately if in case it is not addressed then Escalation Matrix is initiated, an email will be triggered to the Leadership Team then later will loop SDM &  M2 to the same email thread if the ticket is still pending. we never came across such scenario in weekdays but on weekends we have escalated to XLT team in few instances when the Critsit are pending  in queue for more than a hour mark.

#Can I Pick Up A Case on My Own?
Yes! But pay attention to region, product, and follow the procedure outlined in our Case/Collaboration pick up guide below.
