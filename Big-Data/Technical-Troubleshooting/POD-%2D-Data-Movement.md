**4/24/2020: ADF  brown bag / Huddles coming with a couple weeks!**  
 Will do our best to get an AM "early" and PM "later" session on different days to get as many of you as possible exposed to this.  Will want you to have at least L100 done and hopefully L200.  If not and we still have seats will ask you be in listen mode, making notes and prepping questions once you've completed both L100 and L200.   We will have a POC soon.  Thx Lee
