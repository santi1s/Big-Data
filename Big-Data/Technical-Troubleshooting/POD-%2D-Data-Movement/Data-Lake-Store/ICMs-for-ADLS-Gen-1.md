## What Information to Add to ICM

An ICM should cover only one error or issue. If your case has multiple errors or issues that need to be addressed, open multiple ICMs.

### Critical Information
1. The ADLS Account Name
2. The specific error message or issue being experienced by the customer.
3. Timestamp or timeframe that the error or issue was experienced.
4. Link to a Jarvis Query that provides the specific requests that experienced the issue/error.
5. If your Jarvis link contains many requests, either narrow the scope to show only the affected requests, or provide a Specific Activity ID from Jarvis Query that points out a single request.

### Helpful Information
1. The ADLS Account Region
2. A Screenshot of the error
3. Logs from the client side with detailed error information.
4. If relevant, a link to a potentially related ICM.


### Information to Leave Out
1. Identifying information like first and last names of any customers. Including screenshots! If screenshots include last names, or other information that would allow you to identify a person outside of a case, black out that information using an editor.

2. Information about other issues or errors -- unless they are relevant. Again, only one issue should be handled per ICM.
