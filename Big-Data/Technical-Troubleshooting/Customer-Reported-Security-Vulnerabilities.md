We will sometimes see customers open support cases to report security vulnerabilities in our products. A common scenario is that the customer sends us reports from a 3rd party tool with a list of vulnerabilities or rogue network traffic. 

Please refer to guidance from the Microsoft Security Response Center on [reporting security vulnerabilities](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue). Customers should engage this process to report **ANY** Microsoft security vulnerabilities.
