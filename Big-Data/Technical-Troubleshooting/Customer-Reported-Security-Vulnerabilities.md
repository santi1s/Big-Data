We will sometimes see customers open support cases to report security vulnerabilities in our products. A common scenario is that the customer sends us reports from a 3rd party tool with a list of vulnerabilities or rogue network traffic. 

Please refer to guidance from the Microsoft Security Response Center on [reporting security vulnerabilities](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue). Customers should engage this process to report **ANY** Microsoft security vulnerabilities. Another common scenario is that we get requests from customers saying that they receive traffic from certain unknown IPs, that are not part of any of their subscriptions. In this scenario customer should engage CERT team directly, by filling this form: https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/cars
