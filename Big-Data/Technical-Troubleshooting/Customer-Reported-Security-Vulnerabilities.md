We will sometimes see customers open support cases to report security vulnerabilities in our products. A common scenario is that the customer sends us reports from a 3rd party tool with a list of vulnerabilities or rogue network traffic. 

Please refer to guidance from the Microsoft Security Response Center on [reporting security vulnerabilities](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue). Customers should engage this process to report **ANY** Microsoft security vulnerabilities. Another common scenario is that we get requests from customers saying that they receive traffic from certain unknown IPs, that are not part of any of their subscriptions. In this scenario customer should engage CERT team directly, by filling this form: https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/cars

#Process
1. Scope the case and understand what the customer's issue is
2. If customer is reporting unknown IPs or security vulnerabilities, particularly if they are being generated from like a 3rd party report we should send customer messaging like below templates. These issues are out of scope for CSS and should be handled by MSRC.
3. Close out the case once customer has acknowledged the customer messaging. **Do not leave the case open while the customer engages MSRC.** MSRC has final say on these matters. Internally speaking MSRC has a very high bar for what constitutes as malicious behavior and will often tell customers their report does not meet the MSRC criteria of a vulnerability. At that point that is the final answer. Customer cannot come back to support to escalate. MSRC is the final escalation point. 

# Customer Messaging
##Security Vulnerabilities
Here is some example messaging we can share with the customer for **security vulnerabilites:**

_We reviewed the document you provided with a report of security vulnerabilities. Having received similar requests from customers previously, and after working with our security teams and program managers, the process is for customers to work with the [Microsoft Security Response Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue).  Microsoft Security Response Center investigates all reports of security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services.  There is no additional cost for this service._
	
	
_Please do let me know if you would like me to schedule a Teams meeting for us to discuss any questions you may have. Otherwise, the next course of action is for us to archive this support case and you will engage the Microsoft Security Response Center._
 
##Unknown IPs
Here is some example messaging we can share with the customer for **unknown IPs** It's same messaging but different type of form customer needs to fill out.

_We reviewed the document you provided with a report of unknown IPs.
