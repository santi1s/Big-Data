This guide is intended to help you route/handle  Data Factory cases regarding the SSIS IR, and executing SSIS Packages from ADF.

Many of these cases will need support from **SSIS-Skilled Engineers** and **Data Factory-Skilled Engineers**, and this guide will tell you how to route the case and some good first Steps.

# Who should own your case?

If you are an ADF-Skilled engineer or an SSIS-Skilled engineer and have recieved a case with an ADF Azure-SSIS support area path, use these questions to determine who should own your case.

1. What is the support area path?
If the path starts with **IR Management** it should probably be owned by an **ADF-Skilled Engineer**.
If the path starts with **Package Execution** it should probably be owned by an **SSIS-Skilled Engineer**.
If the the path is **How to** - read the description or ask clarifying questions to determine who should own.

2. What is the error message?
If error is an SSIS-Error or mentions "SSIS Error Code", it should probably be owned by an **SSIS-Skilled Engineer**.
If error is from the Data Factory side, or is regarding the SSIS IR it should probably be owned by an **ADF-Skilled Engineer**.
If error is regarding **connectivity** it will likely need **both ADF and SSIS skills.** Create a collaboration for a teammate with the other skillset, rather than transferring the whole case.

3. Unclear?
Reach out to your [TA/SME](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/305780/Regional-Subject-Matter-Experts-(SMEs)) for guidance **OR** create a collab with the opposite-skilled engineer rather than transferring the whole case.
