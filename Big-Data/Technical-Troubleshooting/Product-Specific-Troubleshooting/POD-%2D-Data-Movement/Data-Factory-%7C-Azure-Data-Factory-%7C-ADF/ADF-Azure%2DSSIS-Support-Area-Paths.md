This guide is intended to help you route/handle  Data Factory cases regarding the SSIS IR, and executing SSIS Packages from ADF.

Many of these cases will need support from **SSIS-Skilled Engineers** and **Data Factory-Skilled Engineers**, and this guide will tell you how to route the case and some good first Steps.

# Who should own your case?

If you are an ADF-Skilled engineer or an SSIS-Skilled engineer and have recieved a case with an ADF Azure-SSIS support area path, use these questions to determine who should own your case.

1. What is the support area path?
If the path starts with **IR Management** it should probably be owned by an **ADF-Skilled Engineer**.
If the path starts with **Package Execution** it should probably be owned by an **SSIS-Skilled Engineer**.
If the the path is **How to** - read the description or ask clarifying questions to determine who should own.

2. What is the error message?


# The Support Area Paths (SAPs)

Within Data Factory Cases, there is a topic called "Azure-SSIS" which supports all topics related to running SSIS Packages in Azure using the [SSIS Integration Runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime).

As of today (02/18/2021) there are 8 paths under this topic.
**Some paths require SSIS knowledge.**
**Some paths require ADF knowledge.**
**Some paths will require both.**
