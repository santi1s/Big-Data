# Getting Started


# **Technology Introduction**
Azure Data Catalog is a fully managed cloud service. It lets users discover the data sources they need and understand the data sources they find. At the same time, Data Catalog helps organizations get more value from their existing investments.

With Data Catalog, any user (analyst, data scientist, or developer) can discover, understand, and consume data sources. Data Catalog includes a crowdsourcing model of metadata and annotations. It is a single, central place for all of an organization's users to contribute their knowledge and build a community and culture of data.
