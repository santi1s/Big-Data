1)	We should calm any anxious ADC Gen 1 customers down and say that ADC Gen 1 will continue to be available and we donâ€™t have any deprecation plans yet. We will be running it in sustenance mode though with no new feature development happening. The goal is just to provide 99.9 SLA.

2)	We should not mention/commit about any migration support or utility (manual or automatic). We should just say that we will publish best practices and patterns. We tried working with a partner on a migration utility in ADF v1 and recognized that ADF v1 and v2 are two fundamentally different services with same concepts but different implementations and migration was not possible in a lot of scenarios. Same will be true here from ADC Gen 1 to Babylon as well in the future.

Starting Jan 2021, we will start putting a banner in ADC Gen1 portal experience, telling customers that Babylon is the unified data governance solution with Babylon catalog as the next gen catalog with the latest and greatest features and experiences and encouraging them to try it out. 

Once we hit GA hopefully by June 2021 and have 80-90% feature parity, we can try and use the stick approach again similar to ADF. But we all very well know from ADF v1 experience that retiring a GA service takes 5 years as per Azure Global guidelines.
