**What is an Escalation ?**  
The term ‘escalation’ can be used in a number of contexts.  When the context is understood differently than intended, there can be routing or process issues. There are a variety of ways an Escalation can be initiated.  
Here are some examples:   
-	You have reached Technical roadblock preventing you from moving the SR toward resolution
-	An RFC or Defect needs to be filed / Dumps needs to be analyzed
-	Political Escalations where we need higher levels of expertise from a technical and customer handling standpoint  
-	When a TAM or Customer requests to have the SR escalated after engineers consultation with SME/TA. 
-	The TA / TM suggests it needs to be escalated – This would be a proactive Escalation initiated via reviews by TA/TMs

A request for escalation does not mean the SR becomes a Sev A CritSit.  That is a change in severity.  Changing the severity of a case when the customer really needed an Escalation can be detrimental to the customer experience. 
 
**Two forms of Escalation:** 
-	Pro-active Escalation  
-	Re-active Escalation 

**Pro-active Escalation Process:** 
-	SME/TA requests Escalation resource for assistance based on case reviews 

**Re-active Escalation: Escalation Scenario’s** 
-	SME/TA approves engagement of Escalation resource for assistance through the escalation task.
-	RFCs / HOTFIX / DEFECTs / DCR to be filed 
-	Dump analysis
-	Political Escalation  
-	TAM / Customer /TM requested 

**Escalation Process:** 
At a very high level, this is the workflow we will be following when escalating a case and accepting an escalation.
1.	Engineer creates a CSST note (fills the CSST template attached along) on their SR and requests the regional SME / TA for review. 
2.	Regional SME / TA reviews the CSST note and approves the escalation.
3.	If not approved, the regional SME/TA provides their set of action items to be performed.
4.	If approved, the Engineer creates an Escalation task (fills Escalation Task template attached along) and dispatches to the Escalation queue.
5.	Escalation task is assigned to the regional Escalation resource by DM process. If not assigned, Engineer follows-up with DMs/TA for assignment.
6.	Assigned Escalation resource to work along with the Engineer towards resolution of the issue.

Please note that ALL Escalation requests must go through the SME/ TA for approval prior to transfer of tasks.  If they do not get TA or manager approval, they may be rejected. Continue contact with the customer while the escalation task is being accepted.  All SMEs/TAs/Escalation resources have been / will be briefed on this process.

Global SMEs / Escalation resources: (subjected to change at the discretion of the regional TMs)

|**Region TOD support**  | **Regional SME (1st Level of Escalation) – ACTs as mentors / unblocks the new engineers/ Reviews CSST and approves for escalation.** | **Regional Escalation (2nd level of Escalation) – Works on Escalation Tasks / works with PG team on work items (includes TA/ EE)** |

Please note that our Escalation process is almost similar to that of the [SQL Server (On-Premise) team](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FCSSSQLTeam%2FSitePages%2FProcesses%2FCase-Escalation-Process.aspx&data=04%7C01%7CTiffany.Fischer%40microsoft.com%7C8ad00c735468467b5a3108d8c74b1c21%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637478473223282260%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=y4482TaicVXitSliUO9JTIlv8Wc7uSX57R9iyJZOPWE%3D&reserved=0) with few additional steps being removed so that the SR reaches the Escalation resource much faster.
