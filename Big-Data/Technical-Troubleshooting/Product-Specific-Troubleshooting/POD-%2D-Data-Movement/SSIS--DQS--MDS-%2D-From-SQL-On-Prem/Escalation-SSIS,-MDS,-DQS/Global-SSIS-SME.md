Please note that our Escalation process is almost similar to that of the [SQL Server (On-Premise) team](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FCSSSQLTeam%2FSitePages%2FProcesses%2FCase-Escalation-Process.aspx&data=04%7C01%7CTiffany.Fischer%40microsoft.com%7C8ad00c735468467b5a3108d8c74b1c21%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637478473223282260%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=y4482TaicVXitSliUO9JTIlv8Wc7uSX57R9iyJZOPWE%3D&reserved=0) with few additional steps being removed so that the SR reaches the Escalation resource much faster.
The Escalation process is now added to local <a href="onenote:https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CSSSQLTeam/SSIS  Documents/Troubleshooting Workflows/SSIS Notebook/SSIS Notebook.one#SSIS%20Escalation%20Process&section-id={AD978098-C6E4-41A8-AF9D-402E3CBBEDE1}&page-id={9F8C11B4-7561-444D-B5B6-78CA89CAEBAC}&end">OneNote SSIS Escalation Process</a>.  Reach out to your regional Escalation resources if you have any challenges with escalation process.
