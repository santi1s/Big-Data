#Product Group Engagement:
MDS product maps under the same product team management as SSIS.

 
**How to approach PG team**

| **Product** | **How to approach PG team** | **RFC / HOTFIX Approach** |
|--|--|--|
| Master Data Service (MDS)  |For Advisory questions & Pre-RFC discussions,  approach dedicated PG SPOC (Josh Du (Wicresoft) <v-redu@microsoft.com>) & cc team alias (SQL MDS team <mdstm@microsoft.com>)   | We file RFC / HOTFIX and work together with PG team.|




NOTE: The volume of MDS (<30 cases monthly) is significantly lower than the volume of SSIS (<190 cases monthly) support tickets.

Also please note that the current training covers all the topics of MDS in depth. So there is no separate L100 and L200 categorization of training content due to the depth of the product.

Please reach out to me if you have any follow-up questions.
