NOTE: The volume of MDS (<30 cases monthly) is significantly lower than the volume of SSIS (<190 cases monthly) support tickets.

Also please note that the current training covers all the topics of MDS in depth. So there is no separate L100 and L200 categorization of training content due to the depth of the product.
