Get Preliminary information

**What is the ASA Resource Uri?** 
The Resource URI is the fully qualified ID of the resource, including the resource name and resource type. Use the format: 
/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/{resource-provider-namespace}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}. 

   In a collaboration the Identify Resource URI will not be in the ASC info.  Guessing using the Resource Explorer is not recommended. 

   Ask the Support Engineer if this information has been provided already, but chances are, it has not.
