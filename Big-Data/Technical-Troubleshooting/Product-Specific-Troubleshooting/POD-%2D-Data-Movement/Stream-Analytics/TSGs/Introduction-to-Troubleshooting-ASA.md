**6) Is your SD or IcM ticket lagging in progress?**
Here are some suggestions if your ticket has been open for 4+ days:

Swarm!  You may recall Swarming discussed in CSS training.  
- Find an expert (collaborator or SME to get on a call with the customer)
- Join on Wed the Backlogged ticket meeting during the ASA Triage Morning Meeting 
- Ask PG if you can loop them in on a email thread if questions are still not answered and you rely on the expertise of PG.
- As a last resort, ask a PG if they can get on a call with you and the customer.
