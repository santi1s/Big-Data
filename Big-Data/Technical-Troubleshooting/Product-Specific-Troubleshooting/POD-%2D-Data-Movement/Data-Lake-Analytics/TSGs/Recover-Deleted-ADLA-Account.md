# Recovery Deleted ADLA Account

We are not able to recover a deleted Data Lake Analytics account.
Your customers will need to re-create this data lake analytics resource.

If the customer's Data Lake Store is still in place, we may be able to at least restore the customer's metadata (the metadata is things like Table and Catalog structures.)

To do this, contact the Data Lake Analytics SMS team like you would do for a Disaster Recovery/Failover scenario, and have them restore the metadata from the ADLS to the newly-created Data Lake Analytics resource.
