#Hands-On Training

1. If you do not already have an Azure Subscription, or access to an Azure subscription, please either reach out to your manager/TA, or follow this guide to set up a subscription: https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/azureinternal/CSSMgmt/SitePages/Home.aspx

2. Create an ADLS using the portal: 
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-portal
	
3. Create an ADLS account using PowerShell, to be familiar with Azure PowerSehll: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-powershell
	
4. Make sure you have access to Jarvis:https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/FBF35882Â  

5. Familiarize yourself with Jarvis: https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/285440/Jarvis-for-ADLS-Gen-1
	
7. Using your data lake and new knowledge about how to create access problems, let's simulate some!
a. Create an Azure Data Factory using this tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/load-azure-data-lake-store#create-a-data-factory
b. Assign permissions to this data factory using the MSI (Managed Service Identity) using this tutorial. First, apply good permissions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-store#managed-identity
c. Create a basic copy pipeline using this tutorial (but instead of using Amazon S3 as a source, just have a source folder and a sink folder in your Data lake store, and use the same data lake as both source and sink.)https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/load-azure-data-lake-store#load-data-into-data-lake-storage-gen1
d. Once you have a copy job reliably working, assign bad permissions for your MSI. Re-run your pipeline to see your failure. Try different scenarios:
Incomplete ACL permissions.
Mask on a parent folder.
Mask on a child folder.
Adding a firewall to your data lake store.

8. For each of the scenarios you created before, use Jarvis to search for the error, so you can see what it looks like on the backend!
