# Here's a simple way to light up a group chat with me and the leads in **Teams**. 

1. Select **Manage Tags** in the WW Data Movement Teams
2. Select **Lees team Leads**  _(this includes Lee btw)_
3. Select **Chat with group**  
4. **Done.** You've got a chat group with the current America's leads (including Lee) 

# You would do this for a few reasons:
- Immediate need:  like need to be made unavailable, Escalation, last minute OOF / Sick, question, etc.
