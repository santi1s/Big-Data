Mentoring partnerships can be mutually beneficial and rewarding – on both professional and personal levels. Mentors can develop leadership skills and gain a personal sense of satisfaction from knowing that they've helped someone. 
 
Mentees can expand their knowledge and skills, gain valuable advice from a more experienced person, and build their professional networks. And both partners can improve their communication skills, learn new ways of thinking, and, ultimately, advance their careers. 
 
Mentoring is a key part of our Microsoft culture; and it’s not just for new hires! Mentors help us learn & grow throughout our entire career. You can have technical & career mentors.

1:1 Mentor 
In your first week, you will be assigned a 1:1 mentor who is going to help you on your technical ramp as well as professional development. You are free to chose or change the mentors, after you get to know more people in the company and you identify key strengths that you would like to learn from them (the recommendation is to stick with a mentor between 6 months and 2 years) 
 
Timeline: 
6 Months - 2 years 
 
First Weeks Agenda: 
 
• Week 1-2:

Getting to know each other.
Follow the onboarding Plan.
Go through the global Big Data repository together so that the mentee is aware of existing resources and knows where to find them.
The mentee will reach to the mentor to explain and help him with anything that is unclear on the onboarding plan.
The mentor will follow the mentee's progress using the checkpoints of the technical ramp-up. In case that the learning path is not designed this way - he will agree with the mentee to create some checkpoints, in order to be easier for the mentee to know what to study, and also for the mentor to keep track of the progress.
Introducing the Mentee to Microsoft culture  (Terminology, tools) 
 
• Week 3: 
The mentee will shadow the mentor, doing everyday work and showing the mentee how to manage cases and troubleshoot them. 
Mentor will add his mentee in calls with the customer, so the mentee understands how to drive the conversation. 
 
 
• Week 4: 
Mentor will help identify suitable cases for Mentee to take that are a good start for him. 
The Mentee will take a case and the mentor will monitor how the mentee is going to troubleshoot, document and communicate with the customer.  
 
 
• Week 5: 
Mentor will help identify suitable cases for Mentee to take that will challenge them to grow in the role. 
 
• After week 5: 
Setup (at least biweekly) meeting that suits Mentor/Mentee, during this meeting the mentor will review cases with the mentee and discuss difficulties. 
 
 
Tips for the first 2 months 
 
•  The mentor should be looped on the mentee’s case communications for at least first ~2 months of taking cases. This was a way to give clear visibility to the mentor for case progress, allowed a smooth transition if escalation was needed, and also allowed for better coaching conversations on customer messaging. Also, the other way around, the mentor should cc the mentee on the his cases (at least some of them) for the first couple of months, so he can continue to do shadowing, also after taking his first cases, and get some more tips on how to approach customer and conduct the case. 
• Some scenarios to walked the mentees through hands on (in no particular order): 
• Their first crit 
• Their first 24/7 handoff 
• Their first ICM 
• Their first Genie/Salesforce case (Databricks specific) 
 
 
 
 
 
General guidelines for both mentor and mentee: 
 
• Get to know each other, be curious about them and their background, experiences, learnings.  
• Set the tone for honest and open dialogue.  
• Stick to your commitments.  
• Schedule your meeting series and avoid cancelling.  
• Approach the conversation with a growth mindset.  
• Appreciate the investment they’re making in you.  
• Help each other and be available when needed.  
• Setting clear expectations for your connection is important.  
• Role play situations you find difficult.  
• Exchange and discuss.
