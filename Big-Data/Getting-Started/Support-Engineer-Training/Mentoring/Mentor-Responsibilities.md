First week: 
 
• Welcome the newcomer 
• Introduce him with the team and the workplace 
• Discuss with him the ramp-up plan 
• Assist him to get the IT assets 
• Schedule the required ramp-up meetings for the newcomer 
• Provide feedback about the newcomer results 
• Ensure a smooth POD onboarding for newcomer 
• Go through the learning path with mentee and establish checkpoints 
 
 
Ongoing / as-needed: 
 
• Mentor will add mentee in calls with the customer, so the mentee understands how to drive the conversation. 
• Help identify suitable cases for Mentee to take that will challenge them to grow in the role 
• Assist mentee with questions about case handling processes that come up. Make sure that the mentee is referring to current documentation where applicable rather than simply giving them answers on everything, but do assist on items that are unclear. 
• Provide guidance on technical questions & troubleshooting, and help determine when TA or PG should be engaged.  
Make sure that the mentee is putting in initial effort on research and troubleshooting notes & queries & documenting these clearly before asking you for help on issues.  
• Give the mentee pointers where needed to steer them in correct direction and aid in advanced troubleshooting if needed, but try to let the mentee do the bulk of the work. 
 
 Weekly: 

• Do a spot check of a couple cases and offer mentee suggestions on case handling where you see room for improvement (for example scoping, communication, note-keeping, troubleshooting approach). Gauge where the mentee is making progress and any areas that continue to need improvement.

Reviewing Mentee cases (repeat as needed, until you and mentee believe they have a basic grasp of these stages): 
• Verify Action Plan, Communication and notes. 
• Verify that mentee has delivered the correct solution before closing and having the customer approval. 
• Verify  the mentee is following customer case best practices.
