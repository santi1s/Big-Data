First week: 
 
• Ask questions - don't be afraid to ask any questions to your mentor, colleagues and manager. 
• Go through the onboarding templates/BigData repository and reach your mentor whenever you have any misunderstanding 
• Give feedback regarding the onboarding process - any input is welcome. We are always trying to improve it so it is very appreciated to take some time and send your thoughts. 
 
 
Ongoing / as-needed: 
 
• Remember the mentor is the first person you should reach when stuck with any issue - technical, procedural. If the mentor is not available, feel free to reach any other member of the team, for technical issues preferably someone from the same group as you. 
 
• Look for cases to take, and reach out to mentor if you think a case might be well beyond what you can currently handle. 
Note: We encourage taking on challenging cases, but we can help gauge whether a case is an appropriate fit. 
  
• Reach out to mentor if you have questions about case handling processes or technical questions. 
Before you reach out to the mentor, please be prepared with the following in writing, troubleshooting task note: 
• The specific troubleshooting & analysis that you have done for the issue, including queries and other links and specific relevant details you are calling out in these links. 
• Your thoughts about what action plan to take (e.g. what troubleshooting steps you would recommend next). 
• What is it that you are specifically stuck on? 
• Also reach out to mentor if you are not sure how to properly define the issue or how to otherwise handle it (e.g. if you are not sure how to politically respond to the customer, or how to handle internal processes).  
Try to leverage our internal documentation about processes before reaching out to the mentor, and document the what you propose as options to handle the matter and what challenges & concerns you have with the matter. 
 
**HOWEVER, if you have doubts about how to approach the troubleshooting, don't wait too long to reach out to your mentor. A good rule of thumb is to reach out to your mentor if you are still unsure about how to approach the troubleshooting after ~ an hour of research. 
	 
• Mentor will actively review at least one of your cases to suggest improvements to case handling where needed: 
Ask mentor to review initial case notes with you to make sure that good note-keeping practices are in place.  
 
• Each note on a given troubleshooting or transfer summary task should contain all the relevant info for that task so that engineers can easily review it. Don’t just put the latest note into the task and then expect the engineer to dig through the earlier notes on that task to piece together the summary.
