Basically America's (NA / ATZ / AMER) Our time block around the world is 9:00AM PST to 5:59PM PST (on-call) of **9 hours.** 

However for Azure support for North America its 6 AM PST/PDT to 6 PM PST/PDT M-F of **12 hours.** 


We flex to to the case volumes and needs of the business and not all countries around the world practice Day Light Savings like the America's. (well Arizona doesn't either, must be nice ðŸ˜ƒ)

For North America, Business Hours are defined as 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Pacific time, Monday through Friday excluding holidays for North America. Business Hours change by country and by the local holiday calendar.
