#What is a Buddy?

A Buddy is an engineer that is partnered with a new engineer on the team! The Buddy engineer is there to be a resource to the new engineer as they're onboarding to the team!

#What does a Buddy do?

A Buddy is there to be a resource for the new engineer for questions and best practices! A buddy is there to help a new engineer find their feet and point them in the right direction when they have questions!

##Technical Training

New engineers already have guides on how to get ramped up as a support engineer and have the basics for their technologies. However, a buddy can help point them in the direction of new trainings, the best trainings or practices to get quickly ramped.

Helping an new engineer find information, walking through troubleshooting best practices for your products and cases, and letting a new engineer shadow on your cases are helpful things to do!

##Case Preparedness

Once a new engineer is technically ramped and ready to start taking cases, you can follow the guide below to help them get ready to take cases!

1. A Buddy takes a case from the queue and drives the case with new engineer shadowing. Go through whole case process from how to find a case in the queue, how to assign it to yourself, first email with the customer, troubleshooting, notes, case status... Basically, go through whole case process/life cycle with your new engineer and answer any questions!
Do this for at least one case, but 2 or 3 if possible.
	
2. New Engineer Shadows Mentor and other engineers on troubleshooting calls for cases. No longer a need to go over the whole case, but bringing them into troubleshooting calls and walking them through your troubleshooting thought process and steps so they can see how a case is worked through.
	
3. New Engineer takes their first case with buddy shadowing them. New engineer drives the case, but the buddy to guide them fully through the process for those first 1-2 cases. So basically what you did for step 1, but instead the new engineer is driving the case, and you help them walk through all the steps they need to manage a case.

#Where Can a Buddy Go for Help?
If you have any questions or need any assistance, all new engineers will also have a Mentor, who will be an SME for the product, or a TA for the POD.

If you have questions, if your new engineer has a question you can't answer, or if you have any feedback or concerns, do follow up with any of the following:

1. Reach out to your mentor!
2. Reach out to an SME on your product, or the TA for your POD.
3. Reach out to your manager.

#Feedback on the Buddy Process

If you're a buddy and you have any feedback or any steps to add above, please feel free to add them here to this wiki page, or reach out to your TA!
