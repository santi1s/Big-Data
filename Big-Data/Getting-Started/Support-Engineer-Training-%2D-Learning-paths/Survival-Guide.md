### Case Buddy Organizational Features

Case Buddy is a case management tool that's excellent for self-organization!
It accesses the same information Service Desk has and integrates to allow you to manage and regulate your cases.

Here are some of the best features you can use to Organize your case load using Case Buddy!

All of them are under the "Columns" in your case view at the top of the tool.

If you can't find a column, right-click any column to add new columns to your view.

Then you can use the up and down arrows to organize your columns to whatever order works best for you.

**1. Smileys** - Under your columns in Case Buddy there is the 'Smiley' column:

This column allows you to set a 'Smiley' that will turn red after x number of business days. This is a great way to remind yourself when to follow up on a case! 

**2. Timer** - The first column in Case Buddy is the timer column! Click this column and a timer will automatically start. Click it again and it will stop! Click it again, and the timer will start again at the time it's already at. Click a timer on any other case, and any running timers will stop and and the new timer will start.

This is an easy way to keep track of labor for your various cases as you switch tasks through the day!

**3. Notes** - You can take Notes in Case Buddy and they will be submitted to your case **with any recorded labor already attached.**

Just right-click any case number and select "Open in Case Buddy"

**4. Categories** - Under your columns in Case Buddy is a 'Categories' column that you can customize to have any kinds of categories you need! The goal here is to be able to tell where your cases are at a glance, but this is a tool for you! You can even organize your cases by category.
