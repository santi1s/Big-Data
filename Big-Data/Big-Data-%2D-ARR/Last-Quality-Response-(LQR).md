**Background**
As a part of our efforts to improve CSAT, we are implementing Last Quality Response across Azure Big Data. The process along with pre-defined templates is documented below. This process will streamline the communication and follow up procedures along with empowering the support engineer with pre-defined templates and tools to have a better customer impact. 

**Introduction**
Last Quality Response gives you an opportunity to leave the customer with a good last impression. Set the expectation that a closing email will be sent that captures the issue and resolution. This is something customer can always use if the issue happens again.

Ensuring that CSS is summarizing the issue, that all mitigation/resolution steps are taken, and show customer how to avoid the issue in the future gives additional confidence to customer that the support provided is excellent.

**Dissatisfied Customer:**
If you think that customer can be dissatisfied for any reason, then:
    1 - Discuss as soon as possible this case with a Senior Engineer or Technical Advisor.
    2 - Contact TAM (for Premier cases)
    3 - Use a closure email template.

LQR Should Include:
Customers name
Thank them for using Microsoft Products
Description of the problem
Resolution and recap if long running case
You and your managers contact information
Inform them of the survey and appreciation of feedback
Invitation to reopen if issue reoccurs or not resolved
