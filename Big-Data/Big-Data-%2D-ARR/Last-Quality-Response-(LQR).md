<p style='margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:7pt;line-height:29pt;font-family:&amp;quot;
font-size:24.0pt;color:#1C3A56'>Last Quality Response</p>

Last Quality Response gives you an opportunity to leave the customer with a good last impression. Set the expectation that a closing email will be sent that captures the issue and resolution.  This is something customer can always use if the issue happens again. 

Ensuring that CSS is summarizing the issue, that all mitigation/resolution steps are taken, and show customer how to avoid the issue in the future gives additional confidence to customer that the support provided is excellent.

## Dissatisfied Customer:
<p style='margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt;color:red'><span style='font-weight:bold' lang="en-US"></span><span style='font-weight:bold' lang="zh-CN">If you think that customer can be dissatisfied for any reason, then:<br>
  1 - Discuss as soon as possible this case with a Senior Engineer or Technical Advisor.<br>
  2 - Contact TAM (for Premier cases)<br>
  3 - Use a closure email template. </span><span style='font-weight:bold' lang="en-US"><br></span></p>


## LQR Should Include:
- Customers name
- Thank them for using Microsoft Products
- Description of the problem
- Resolution and recap if long running case
- You and your managers contact information
- Inform them of the survey and appreciation of feedback
- Invitation to reopen if issue reoccurs or not resolved

## LQR Should Avoid:
- Contacting and closing cases on holidays, weekends and after working hours. 


# General LQR workflow for Un-Responsive Customers:
The below workflow gives a general idea about the process CSS should follow when working with an un-responsive customer. CSS should always take into account the case context and customer sentiment.

## Important Notes:
- If seeking a Manager recovery, do not close until complete.
- Update root cause as accurate as you can. Please report missing/inaccurate root causes to Sunil/Deepti (sunilkc@microsoft.com, deeptivu@microsoft.com) and they will get this updated.
- Please update “Cause”, “Resolution” and “Symptom” fields in Service Desk as this helps reviewers looking at cases to get an overview. You can use the same text for these which you will anyways send to the customer by email based on above templates.
- Change the Title to ensure it makes sense to the customer so when surveyed they are clear on case they are being surveyed on.  Example: ”Not connecting to VM"
- Keep “Notes” up-to-date. 
- Even if the issue is resolved over phone, please mention what was the issue and how this was resolved in the case communications.
