**Last Quality Response:** gives you an opportunity to leave the customer with a good last impression. Set the expectation that a closing email will be sent that captures the issue and resolution. This is something customer can always use if the issue happens again.
1.	Ensure a summary if the issue
2.	Make sure all mitigation/resolution steps are taken
3.	Show the customer how to avoid the issue in the future --> (This gives additional confidence to the customer that the support provided is excellent)



LQR Should **Include:**
1.	Customers name
2.	Thank them for using Microsoft Products
3.	Description of the problem
4.	Resolution and recap if long running case
5.	You and your managers contact information
6.	Inform them of the survey and appreciation of feedback
7.	Invitation to reopen if issue reoccurs or not resolved


LQR Should ****Avoid**:**
1.	Contacting and closing cases on holidays, weekends and after working hours.


****Dissatisfied Customer**:** If you think that customer can be dissatisfied for any reason, then:
1.	Discuss as soon as possible this case with a Senior Engineer or Technical Advisor, they may suggest looping in the PG as well. **_Do not delay asking for help if the customer is dissatisfied_**
2.	Contact the TAM (_**for Premier cases**_) 
3.	Follow the process for CSAT Impacting IcMs and Consider a recovery call (**_if applicable_**)


**LRQ General workflow for an Un-Responsive Customer:**
The below workflow gives a general idea about the process for CSS to follow when working with an un-responsive customer. **_CSS should always consider the case context and customer sentiment_**.

**Scenarios:**
The following samples gives you an idea of what a LQR might look like. Make sure you personalize your emails to customers, you can and should always place some personal touch and express your friendly attitude on any email to customer.

**Resolved**:
1.	Standard Case Closure
2.	Resolved by Customer


**Un-Resolved**:
The customer has stopped responding to calls or emails, please make sure to **_CC the TAM and Manager on LQR emails_**. If customer is **_Premier, work with the TAM_** to help contact the customer to verify the case is ready to close.

1.	Follow-up 
2.	2nd Attempt (Unresponsive customer)
3.	Final Attempt (Unresponsive customer)
4.	Closure Email
