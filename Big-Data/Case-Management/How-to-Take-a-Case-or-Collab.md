**This is the current process for our Service Desk tool, and covers only the basics for picking up a case/collaboration from the queue, or starting a case/collaboration that has been assigned to you.**

# Taking a Case or Collab from the Queue

##Find Cases in Your Technology
1. On Your Service Desk Home Page, visit the Unassigned Cases Tile and Select 'View All'
Or visit this site: https://servicedesk.microsoft.com/#/mycases/unassignedcases

2. Your Unassigned Cases should already be narrowed to the queues you are a part of, so you can just look at the 'Support Area Path' column to find cases relevant to your technologies.

2. However, you can also edit the table to view cases for only specific Technologies, by clicking "Show Editor"

Here you can add  filter for "Support Area Path", make sure it starts with your technology (in this example, Data Factory) and 'Save As'. You'll be saving this as a new view that you can switch to anytime you want to see cases of a specific technology.

2. Check the 'Sev' column to check Severity, or the 'Service Level' column to check if it is a Professional or Premier Case

##Check If It Is a Full Case or a Collab

1. Check the Type column to see if the pending task is a Collaboration, or a full Case

###Notify DMs (Duty Managers)
After you have assigned a case or collaboration to yourself, be sure to reach out to your duty managers to let them know they no longer need to find a case owner.
