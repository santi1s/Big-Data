#Good Note Taking
The goal of your notes should be that anyone that  looks at your latest case notes should be able to quickly identify the issue your are addressing, the current status, and what the planned next steps are.

Write the notes you would want to see if you were coming to the case totally new and need to pick up where the last engineer left off.

This will make it easy for you to trace your steps, and for your fellow engineers to be able to help if you open a collaboration, need to hand off, take a sick day, or just need a second opinion!
