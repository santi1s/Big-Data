##Steps for Case Closure in Service Desk
After you have confirmed closure with your customer and sent the last quality response to your customer, follow the steps below to close out your case.

1. If your case is a Severity A case, reduce severity to B and then save before proceeding with case closure.
2. Change case state to 'Closed' and Status to the appropriate status for the case. Most usually status will be 'Resolved', but there are some exceptions.
3. Add notes to Cause, Resolution, and Symptom sections under the 'Details' tile.

These notes are a quick-reference for anyone looking at the case to understand what the issue was, why it occurred, and how to resolve it. 
Anybody looking at this case should be able to look at the symptoms to see if it matches their own issue, and if it does they should be able to find the cause of the issue and know how to resolve it from these notes, without having to look at your full case notes or email.
Under 'Resolution', also provide any workarounds that helped to mitigate the issue while the root cause was addressed/researched.
4. Add 'Agent Identified Root Cause'

You will need to select the most specific root cause possible, which is to say you cannot choose a root cause with subtopic underneath. You will need to choose one of the subtopics.
The product team uses this 'Root Cause' data to understand what kinds of cases they see most frequently for their product.
5. Enter Labor time for case closure process/any outstanding labor not yet entered for the case.
6. Select 'End' which will save and close out the case.
