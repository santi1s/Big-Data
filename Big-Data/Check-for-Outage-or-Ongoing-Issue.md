**NOTE**
_This is a Work in Progress. 
Many teams have specific  Teams channels devoted to outage/important information! 
Follow up with your SME for more information!_

_For now, here are some places to get started checking for an ongoing issue:_



Three places:

1. Azure Status - https://status.azure.com/en-us/status
Though generally this won't be updated until we've known about an outage for a while already and only if it affects a whole region/a lot of Cx.

2. My go to is under the icm just going to incidents-> queries and looking at the team I need for the date range I need and see what ICMs are up. Looking for Sev 2s but otherwise anything that has my same description in the title.

3. Icm going to the Outages tab. This will show you a report similar to azure status -- just internal. Any sev 2s are reported here.
