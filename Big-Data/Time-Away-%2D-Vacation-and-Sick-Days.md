# Benefits Page/Microsoft Policy
_This guide that covers best practices on the Big Data team for requesting/logging Vacation and Sick Days.
Please do refer to our benefits site (//benefits) and our Human Resources site (//hrweb) or reach out to your manager for additional questions, or conversations about specific scenarios._

# Sites You Will Need
_If you do not have access to either site, please reach out to your manager or TA_

**WFM:** https://wfm2.corp.microsoft.com/WFO/WFMPRD/home/dashboard/
This site is for vacation/schedule requests, as well as viewing your shift times and queue times.

**TAR:** https://tar/Common/Home.aspx (//tar)
This is the Time and Absence Microsoft site where you can see vacation and sick leave balances, as well as the site where you record any vacation, sick leave, Jury Duty, or Bereavement (this guide does not cover bereavement or jury duty. Please look into benefits to reach out to your manager if you have question about bereavement or jury duty processes)
# Vacation
## Check Available Vacation Time
1. Go to //tar to check your total vacation balance as of the present date. You can see it here:

2. You can also check for any Flex/Lieu Days on WFM (see section below for Flex/Lieu Days), by going to Personal Accounts, entering the date, and checking your current balance.

## Request Vacation

1. Go to WFM and select "Schedule Editor"

2. Select +Segment

3. Under 'Code', select the kind of time block you are submitting. For the purposes of vacation time, you'll either use "Planned OOF" which uses your vacation days, or Flex/Lieu Used, if you are using some earned Flex time.

4. Select your date range (feel free to include weekends), and then you can use the "Days" menu to select only days you would normally have a shift. Select "All Day" if you will be out of office the full day. The Memo is optional. You do not need to report why you are taking time off.

5. Select "Add" at the bottom of the page.

```
Note that selecting "Add" does not guarantee vacation time.
This time still needs to be approved by your manager.
```

6. Send an email to your manager indicating that you have submitted a request for the specified day/days, and cc the WFM scheduling team (wfms@microsoft.com).

## Check if Vacation Was Approved
1. When vacation is approved and your schedule is updated, you will receive an email telling you what dates have been updated.

2. You can go to WFM, then to the schedule editor, and navigate to the requested date. If your vacation has been approved, your schedule will include a Planned OOF/ Flex Time block that will cover the whole day.

## Add Vacation to Outlook Calendar

After your vacation is approved, you should add an Out of Office appointment to your outlook, so you appear out of office when coworkers try to ping you or try to request a meeting time.

1. In Outlook, go to New Items, then 'Appointment'

2. Set 'Show As' to Out of Office and 'Reminder' to None. Title it with <your alias> OOF, and select the appropriate time range. Then save the appointment.

You can also add your vacation to a teammates calendar! Do this if you have teammates you work closely with, like members of your POD. **But do not send your teammates an appointment that is set to 'Show As' Out of Office.**
To add your vacation to a teammate's calendar (so they know when you are out, and when you will be back) do the following:
1. In Outlook, select 'New Item' and then 'Appointment'. Then, to invite others, click 'Invite Attendees'

![image.png](/.attachments/image-1ebb5bfe-2247-42f1-83b3-3a9b556ececf.png)

2. Be sure to Set 'Show As' to Free and 'Reminder' to None. 
Add all relevant team members under "Required", mark the appropriate days, and add a note about your vacation days and when you'll be back for quick reference.

## Automatic Replies
For long vacation or sick days, it is good to set automatic replies that contain your expected return date, so teammates and customers know when you are expected to be back, and if there are any other avenues of communication open to them in your absence. Below are example automatic replies for both Internal, and External communications, as well as steps to set them.

1. In Outlook, go to 'File', then to 'Automatic Replies'
![image.png](/.attachments/image-d62146c0-06d8-4b19-9cb4-c05ae28bf6d9.png)
![image.png](/.attachments/image-244dddfa-1461-40fc-b7ff-1ee57ad00490.png)

2. Set the option to 'Send Automatic Replies', and then 'Only send during this time range'
Set the time range for the dates of your vacation.

3. You'll note there are two reply options, one for Inside your Organization (the message people within Microsoft will receive) and Outside your Organization (the message outside customers will receive).
Please set both, though do use different messages. Here are some examples.
