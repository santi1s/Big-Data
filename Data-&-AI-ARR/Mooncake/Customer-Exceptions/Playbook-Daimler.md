**Precautions for Daimler HDInsight cases handling**.
1.	Call customer immediately within 15 minutes to gather detail information. 
2.	If you can't reach customer, contact CSAM Leah Zhang (qizhang3@microsoft.com) to know current status or more details. 
3.	Get customer approval to access their HDInsight cluster through email. 
4.	Use Jarvis to get the Ambari and SSH user name, password. For ssh login, you need a Mooncake VM as a jump server. 
5.	After using the credential, you need to delete it in time. 
6.	Daimler uses ESP cluster. Need also check AAD DS status for authentication issues. 
7.	Update SEVA status to customer at least every 1 hour.
