Travis LaGrone has a guide! Reach out to him.
(Soon we'll have the guide here!)

1. Set up a personal GitHub account and configure 2FA.
2. Request access to MicrosoftDocs.
	Find azure-docs-pr, and explain why it should be used instead of azure-docs.
	Find databricks-pr, and explain how it relates to each of docs.databricks.com and docs.microsoft.com/azure.
	Fork a repo using GitHub in the browser.
	Install Git for Windows and VS Code.
	Clone a repo from GitHub to local using Git in VS Code.
	Edit Docs-flavored Markdown using the Docs Authoring Pack in VS Code.
	Commit and push using Git in VS Code.
	Create a pull request from the fork to the original using GitHub in the browser.
