Travis LaGrone has a guide! Reach out to him.
(Soon we'll have the guide here!)

1. Set up a personal GitHub account and configure 2FA.
2. Request access to MicrosoftDocs.
3. Find azure-docs-pr, and explain why it should be used instead of azure-docs.
4. Find databricks-pr, and explain how it relates to each of docs.databricks.com and docs.microsoft.com/azure.
	
5. Fork a repo using GitHub in the browser.
6. Install Git for Windows and VS Code.
7. Clone a repo from GitHub to local using Git in VS Code.
8. Edit Docs-flavored Markdown using the Docs Authoring Pack in VS Code.
9. Commit and push using Git in VS Code.
10. Create a pull request from the fork to the original using GitHub in the browser.
