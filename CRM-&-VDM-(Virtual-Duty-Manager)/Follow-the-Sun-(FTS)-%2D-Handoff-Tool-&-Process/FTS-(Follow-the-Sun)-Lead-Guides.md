# How Long Will Leads Need to Review and Process Transfers?
Currently we have requested that our support engineers complete their FTS requests up to the “Ensure Summary” stage, and then leave it to the Leads to confirm and complete the transfer at the time of the handover call.

This is to ensure that our engineers correctly complete the transfer process and that they are moving valid transfers.

**However, there is no mechanical reason that leads need to do this.** Engineers can complete the FTS process themselves, and we would like to empower them to do so! This will reduce the workload on both engineers and leads and make the handover process much smoother.

**So, when can we transition to the self-serve model for our engineers?**

We leave this to the judgment of the leads who manage each handover call.

Whenever you are comfortable with the quality of handovers at your handover call, please empower your engineers to complete the FTS transfer process themselves.

It is suggested to do daily reviews for at least two weeks before phasing out lead reviews. However, use discretion for your own regions and handover calls.

# How Does FTS Assign Cases?
FTS uses a flavor of VDM! However, FTS:
- **Does NOT** do prebooking - FTS only looks for currently available engineers.
- **DOES** respect WFM schedules- For Severity A cases, FTS Will not assign a case if an engineer if the engineer has fewer than 2 hrs available on their schedule.
For example - if your engineer has lunch less than 2 hrs after the handover call time, they will not show as available to take a case.
- **DOES** respect capacity - if your engineer has already received a case, FTS will respect the timing limitations based on the severity of a case and will not assign a case within those thresholds.
