## Share FTS Request Link

The URL in the browser will **NOT** link to your specific request.

If you want to send a link to your specific request to someone, either in email or in chat, you'll need to use this "email a link" button in the FTS request, which will open a new email that contains the actual link.

## Use

After selecting a Handover call, in this menu you can see all the FTS transfer requests.

These requests are added by one of two methods.
1. [Automatically](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/393781/FTS-(Follow-the-Sun)-User-Guides?anchor=automatic-handover-request) – Based on Severity and Status, FTS will automatically create a request.
2. [Manually](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/393781/FTS-(Follow-the-Sun)-User-Guides?anchor=manual-handover-request) – An engineer creates a transfer request for their case.

Below is a description of all the parts of the handover menu.

![image.png](/.attachments/image-d7f9578b-0669-4c97-8e54-3b9a901b9c20.png)

1.	General handover call time and information.
2.	Handover meeting URL. (This is a link to our existing handover teams meetings.)
3.	Links to the FTS requests for each case.
4.	Service request number associated with each case.

To modify/update an FTS request, select the link to the FTS request for your case number.

# Automatic Handover Request
Cases that meet the criteria below will be automatically added to the FTS list to be approved for transfer.
-	Sev A “CritSit” cases
-	Sev B cases with 24x7 Requested flagged

If a case has an automatic handover request created, the engineer associated with the case will receive an FTS communication email 3 hours before the handover call.

The case can also be found in the [handover call menu](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/393781/FTS-(Follow-the-Sun)-User-Guides?anchor=access), or under the [case's FTS requests list.](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/393781/FTS-(Follow-the-Sun)-User-Guides?anchor=check-fts-requests-for-case)

### Notes Template

**Template for Transfer Summary:**

Reason for Transfer
\=============================
<Provide brief summary of reason for transfer.>

Next Steps for Case
\=============================
<List or summary of the next steps that need to be taken on the case.



## Complete Transfer

### Select Resource

1. Under “Select Resource” there are three options to choose a resource in the next region.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-abbbaab2-5c3c-4701-a2b4-3c0e506ed437.png)

a. **Automatic** – The option you will most often use. Automatic uses VDM to choose the next engineer available in the region you are transferring to. It favors engineers who have owned the case in the past.
b. **Manual** – allows you to manually choose an engineer to assign to in the next region.
c. **Skip** – Allows the transfer to skip the current region and move on to the next. For more information, see the [“How to Skip a Region” section.](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/393781/FTS-(Follow-the-Sun)-User-Guides?anchor=how-to-skip-regions)

 2. If you chose "Skip" select 'Next Stage' to proceed.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-b3147c0e-5ba1-42e5-859c-cbcbaa94beba.png)

3. If you chose "Manual" or "Automatic" another stage will appear after the 'Select Resource' section. Select 'Next Stage' to proceed to it.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-d964cb44-f44a-489e-b784-1f1be033a55a.png)

4. If you chose "Manual" select a resource to transfer the case to using the search button. A list of engineers in the next region should appear, but you may also search by name. After selecting an engineer choose "Next Stage" to proceed.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-5c82349a-0ab8-466a-820b-79f70875beb4.png)

5. If you chose "Automatic" simply choose "Next Stage" to proceed. FTS will fill in an available resource from the next region. **It takes about 30 seconds-1 minute to complete this process, and the page looks like it is hanging. Just wait.** There is a little "Saving" icon in the bottom corner to show you that it is working.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-c8c1f341-7b6b-4207-9f1b-049a5ed4cecc.png)
If a resource isn't automatically selected, it is likely that based on FTS/VDM rules, an engineer isn't available. 
For a Sev A FTS requires that an engineer have at least 2 hours free on their schedule to be able to take the case.
You will need to press the back arrow, change the assignment type to "Manual" and manually find an owner.

### All Done?

1. After all other fields have been filled out, select “Finish” in the All Done stage. This will initiate the transfer at the time of the handover call.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-f0f0f13b-1583-4dcc-97a4-6f1812a20d50.png)

# How to Skip Regions

Let us say, for example, you have a case in EMEA that needs to skip AMER and go straight to APAC.
You can use FTS to perform this transfer.

1.  You fill out your FTS transfer as normal, and in the “Transfer To” section, you pick **the next region** Choose the next handover call and the next region, as the case will still need to pass through that region to get to the region you need. So for our example, you would still choose “Americas” as the next region, and the EMEA->AMER handover call as the next handover call.
 ![image.png](/.attachments/image-e05f83d3-9d47-4dc7-9472-0dbf1bbfe9c3.png)

2. Fill out the rest of the transfer as normal, and in the summary notes specify that the case needs to skip a region and why.
 ![image.png](/.attachments/image-15e216b1-dd66-4765-813d-cdaa2634900e.png)

3. Then in the “Select Resource” Section the Lead will see that the case needs to skip the region and choose “Skip”. The transfer will then skip the region and be moved to the next, where the leads can choose to process the assignment for that region.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-28bcc69c-8cb3-4fc9-accd-3ba685b54722.png)
 

4. After you have selected “All Done” and finished the request, the ‘Next Transfer’ will pop up, showing a transfer request to the next handover call. Fill out that transfer request up through to “Ensure Summary” with a copy of the transfer notes from the previous request.
 ![image.png](/.attachments/image-ae1699ed-8c6f-482a-8abf-9e4ec0dae642.png)

# Delete or Deactivate FTS Request

To delete an unnecessary transfer request, select the “Delete” icon at the top of the page. Deleting the request will remove it entirely and all work will be lost.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-9d835fbc-7f9c-4520-b69d-bebc5ffdfbbd.png)

To deactivate an unnecessary transfer request, select the “Deactivate” icon at the top of the page. Deactivating a request will remove it from the FTS transfer list on your handoff call, but will not delete the request, which can be re-activated at any time.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-9ef1a928-eee6-4cc3-bf30-873f133f1fa4.png)

A request can also be deleted directly from the handover list on the handover call by scrolling right to the end of the table and selecting the trash can.

# Troubleshooting

**Unable to Automatically Select an Engineer?**
_Issue:_
You are attempting to use 'Automatic' to select a resource, but when you use "Next Stage" you receive an error that you cannot select a resource.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-b58887b9-8244-435f-a2d6-4f95b5bd83cc.png)
 
_Resolution:_
There have been some issues with CRM. Please use the Manual transfer to select a resource in the next region and report the issue in your [Leads Teams Channel](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki/394171/FTS-(Follow-the-Sun)-Lead-Guides?anchor=leads-teams-channels)
 

**Can’t Update Your FTS Request?**

_Issue:_
You cannot update your FTS Request, can’t save it, and your stages show little lock icons.
![image.png](/.attachments/image-77e1d2ab-04f6-4445-a8c4-563e57b92d11.png)
 
_Resolution:_
Your FTS request is inactive. You can see this at the bottom of the page.
This is likely because there is already another active FTS request for this case.
You can either [check for the existing FTS request](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/Big%20Data/_wiki/wikis/Big-Data.wiki?wikiVersion=GBwikiMaster&_a=edit&pagePath=%2FCRM%20%26%20VDM%20(Virtual%20Duty%20Manager)%2FFollow%20the%20Sun%20(FTS)%20%252D%20Handoff%20Tool%20%26%20Process%2FFTS%20(Follow%20the%20Sun)%20User%20Guides&pageId=393781&anchor=check-fts-requests-for-case) and fill out that request. OR you can re-activate your current request and continue there.
Select “Activate” to continue working on your FTS request.
