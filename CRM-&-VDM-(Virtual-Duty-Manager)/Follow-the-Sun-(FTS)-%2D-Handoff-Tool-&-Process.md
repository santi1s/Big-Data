# FTS FAQ's

Yes.  _Hint: Why? Follow-up Region_

**I don't understand FTS, what to do, when, or how. What do I do?** 
Thanks for asking. start here, please consume this content. 
Then ask your peers, and if busy, your leads and/or M1's for help.   if you don't know, ask. 

**How do I get access to FTS?** 
if you have/use VDM then you already have access to it. 
Don't have VDM? engage the Case Assignment Leads to request one.



**Who are the Case Assignment Leads for Data Movement and where do I find them / engage them?**

Enagement can be via Chat in the VDM channel or make a task in the VDM channel top bar called **_**Task-Issues**_**. in the Lead Requests:, click + Add task


**Moving to FTS seems too easy. What's the most important think I need to do?**
Case notes / Documentation becomes very important as well case management- if your handing a case inter region or between regions and the case doesn't meet the hand off criteria the hand off notes MUST make it very clear why. 

**Can I skip a region using FTS?**
Yes! See the "Guide for SEs" document above for more information.
