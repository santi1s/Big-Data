**I don't understand FTS, what to do, when, or how. What do I do?** 
Thanks for asking. start here, please consume this content. 
Then ask your peers, and if busy, your leads and/or M1's for help.   if you don't know, ask. 

**How do I get access to FTS?**

**Moving to FTS seems too easy. What's the most important think I need to do?**
Case notes / Documentation becomes very important as well case management- if your handing a case inter region or between regions and the case doesn't meet the hand off criteria the hand off notes MUST make it very clear why. 

**Can I skip a region using FTS?**
Yes! See the "Guide for SEs" document above for more information.
