Yes.

if you have/use VDM then you already have access to it. 
Don't have VDM? engage the Case Assignment Leads to request one.

Enagement can be via Chat in the VDM channel or make a task in the VDM channel top bar called **_**Task-Issues**_**. in the Lead Requests:, click + Add task

**Moving to FTS seems to easy. what's the most important think I need to do?**
Case notes / Documentation becomes very important as well case management- if your handing a case inter region or between regions and the case doesn't meet the hand off criteria the hand off notes MUST make it very clear why.
