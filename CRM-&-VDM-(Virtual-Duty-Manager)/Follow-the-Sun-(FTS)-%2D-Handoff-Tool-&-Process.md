# FTS FAQ's
**Can I use this to hand a case off within my own region?** 
No. If you need to transfer a case to another engineer within your team and region either find a teammate wo can take the case, work with your TA to find a teammate who can pick up the case, or return the case to the queue using "Transfer" and "Administrative Transfer"

**I don't understand FTS, what to do, when, or how. What do I do?** 
Thanks for asking. start here, please consume this content. 
Then ask your peers, and if busy, your leads and/or M1's for help.   if you don't know, ask. 

**How do I get access to FTS?** 
if you have/use VDM then you already have access to it. 
Don't have VDM? engage the Case Assignment Leads to request one.



**Who are the Case Assignment Leads for Data Movement and where do I find them / engage them?**
The names are updated in the WW Data Movement Teams -> VDM channel file called [Case Assignment Leads](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/WWDataMovement/EdlJ69AUILVBij1KpuH35X4Ba3NPuaL_pJSPpNj3z_HO5A?e=Pwnivy) 

Enagement can be via Chat in the VDM channel or make a task in the VDM channel top bar called **_**Task-Issues**_**. in the Lead Requests:, click + Add task


**Moving to FTS seems too easy. What's the most important think I need to do?**
Case notes / Documentation becomes very important as well case management- if your handing a case inter region or between regions and the case doesn't meet the hand off criteria the hand off notes MUST make it very clear why. 

**Can I skip a region using FTS?**
Yes! See the "Guide for SEs" document above for more information.
