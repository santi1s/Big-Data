## Long term plan / goal
CSS ultimately owns the Cx experience, so CXD enabled chat for our Cx and will eventually be phased out.   Chat will like a call in or an email case. Over time will be be enabling more SAP's across all our products which chat is a better option.   

We will need to figure out how to make Chat BAU, and able to move our teams in/out of Chat dynamically as volumes change bi-directionally.

## How to / FAQ's
- [Log into Chat](/Chat-Support/Log-into-Chat)

**What do you do when your support Chat as a SE?**
- Option 1: (preferred during 1st few weeks) At _**LEAST**_ a day before your going to be supporting Chat,  send an email to WFM Scheduling Team (wfms@microsoft.com)  to mark you "Research", CCing Lee, and the Leads (Whitney, Sundar, Alex) for all day on DATE (Month, Day, Year)
- Option 2: When you _start your shift_ send a group Chat to the leads asking asking them to make you unavailable with the CRMBot since your supporting Chat that day.    Remember :
- [ ] VDM won't assign you a case for the 1st 30 min of your schedule, so you if you didn't make the WFM request prior you'll need to do this.
- [ ] You still could get asked to do a collaboration task since the DM uses RAT.  

**How do I know who's supporting Chat when I am?** 
enter Teams Channel please - Azeeth, Azith, Dianna

**How do I know when I'm doing chat support?**
pilot team is rotating daily and using an Excel spreadsheet 

Can I work other cases or do other things? 
technically no, we've got 15 seconds to respond to a Chat request.   However since  you've got multiple windows / screens theres alot of down time right now so you could work on training , eamil catch up , etc. as long as youre keeping an eye on Chat. 

What do I do when I go on meal brake/ lunch since I'm Research in WFM now??
enter Teams Channel please - Azeeth, Azith, Dianna
