ASC supports creation and deployment of Insight Diagnostics using a simplified experience via [Elixir](https://elixir.microsoft.com/solutions/insights?supportscope=d1e1cc31-42ce-53d2-f83d-18be2124f44f). Following a simple wizard you can create Kusto-based diagnostics to help customers and support engineers troubleshoot problems. NoCode insights through [Elixir](https://elixir.microsoft.com/solutions/insights?supportscope=d1e1cc31-42ce-53d2-f83d-18be2124f44f) enables you to create and publish Insigths in minutes thanks to reduced dev cost investment and self-serve deployment process.

In this wiki, we are going to share all the steps to help you implement an Insight in Elixir. After going through this document you will have a fairly good understanding of the end-to-end process to create a No Code Insight through Elixir.
