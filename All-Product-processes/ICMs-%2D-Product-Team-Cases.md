# Severity Best Practices
ICM Severity - we had an escalation recently and realized that we had been a bit conditioned by some PGs on setting severity. We are resetting and aligning our approach to the following:


**Outage:                          ICM Sev 1
	Sev A case:                      ICM Sev 2
	Sev B/C case:                  ICM Sev 3**


_Q. If we are working on a sev A , what severity for an ICM do we set?_  

A. We create an ICM with Sev 2



_Q. If we are working on a Sev B and created CRI 3 and then the case severity increases to A , do we change the ICM severity?_ 

A. Yes, we change accordingly from Sev 3 to Sev 2.
