# Severity Best Practices
ICM Severity - we had an escalation recently and realized that we had been a bit conditioned by some PGs on setting severity. We are resetting and aligning our approach to the following:


**Outage:                          ICM Sev 1
	Sev A case:                      ICM Sev 2
	Sev B/C case:                  ICM Sev 3**


_Q. If we are working on a sev A , what severity for an ICM do we set?_  

A. We create an ICM with Sev 2



_Q. If we are working on a Sev B and created CRI 3 and then the case severity increases to A , do we change the ICM severity?_ 

A. Yes, we change accordingly from Sev 3 to Sev 2.

#ICM Tracking
##Create a list of 'your' ICMs
Need a list of ICMs associated with your cases? Whenever you create an ICM or receive a case with an ICM, you can add it to your 'Tracked' list.
1. Open the ICM and select '...More", then pick "Track"

2. Select 'Watch' and then 'Add tracking'

This will ad the incident to your 'Tracked Incidents' list.

3. Find your 'Tracked Incidents' list under 'Dashboard' and 'My Tracked'
